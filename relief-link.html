<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>As part of a project at General Assembly, I worked as the UX researcher focusing on redesigning the Puget Sound Trip Planner mobile app. I worked together with the Project Manager and Interaction Designer to create an interactive prototype of the redesign.</p>

<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>The most glaring problem was the non-intuitive interface of the app. This was the main focal point of our redesign. In addition, some of the features on the app were not even functional such as adding routes to your favorites list. </p>

<h1>Solution</h1>

<p>Puget Sound Trip Planner was completely redone. Content and information was reorganized to meet our user’s needs. Emphasis was put on structuring content around Trip Planner’s alerts feature and making it more intuitive. </p>

<h1>Strategic Analysis</h1>

<p>Users suggested that Puget Sound Trip Planner would be more intuitive if it followed some design patterns of their favorite apps. In response to this, my team took a look at competitors app layouts and paid close attention to the apps mentioned in user interviews (Google, Apple, and One Bus Away). My discovery was that these more popular apps had a map on the home screen as well as minimal navigation. Puget Sound Trip Planner has an unwelcoming interface and is not intuitive to use. The app has a map which allows to find your destination relative to where you are, but it took some additional navigation to get to that feature.</p>

<h1>Research</h1>

<p>To find out better who my users were and what their needs and wants were, we went out and asked people near bus stops and public locations about what kind of mobile transportation app they used. These people ranged from students to working adults. Based on the research we collected, we discovered 6 out of 7 people we tested used 2 or more transportation apps for specific purposes. For example, people used Google Maps because it is easy and intuitive to find directions. However, at an actual bus stop, people would utilize One Bus Away because it provided them with real time information of when the bus would arrive. Google Maps does not always provide reliable or real time information. </p>





<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I thought that we should have started our first design iterations on paper or at low fidelity even though I understood the argument of making things more detailed to assist with user guidance. We jumped to mid-fidelity using Sketch and inVision. As a result, this made it harder to pin-point issues that could’ve been related to the core of the design rather than the specific features. Because we started with a mid fidelity design, we were confined to it. I felt that was evidently the case during our three usability tests. The feedback we received from the users was largely inconsistent.

I also should have interviewed people that used Puget Sound Trip Planner. While I tried to see if the people I interviewed had used this specific app before during my user interviews, I admit I did not exercise all communication channels to see if other people had used Puget Sound Trip Planner app. This was largely due to the time. This resulted in borrowing design ideas and getting inspiration from other apps rather than focusing on what to specifically fix based on the existing Puget Sound Trip Planner app. 

I think we did a good job with our presentation in terms tying in our user persona. We constantly communicated what we were going to do and delivered a prototype that was extremely detailed.</p>

          Hazel Analytics is a food tech company specializing in food safety analytical software that they market to restaurants to drive business growth and provide business insights. As part of our client project at General Assembly, I worked as the Interaction Designer tasked with creating an interactive prototype on the iPad platform. Given that we only had 3 weeks, our team, consisting of myself, the Project Manager, and the UX Researcher, focused on the onboarding experience.

        <p>
          Restaurant owners need a simple way to stay prepared and informed about food safety to help them and their staff plan efficiently and effectively for health department inspections.

            Focusing on the default view, customizable dashboard, and the onboarding experience of the app will help restaurant owners better prepare for future health inspections with useful insights whilst also providing them with an overall intuitive experience.

        <p>
          I conducted a comparative analysis on existing apps in the food safety space to discover common features. These included the ability to share information, get help, and visualize data. Even though our topic was very niche, we took notes from existing features in similar apps to help with feature prioritization.

        <p>
          We discovered through affinity mapping that single and multi restaurant owners had different motivations and attitudes toward food safety inspection. This led to the creation of two different user personas. From a design perspective, this meant creating two different designs.

         Using Optimal Workshop, we were able to map out the architecture and sitemap. This allowed me hone in on the MVP and know what to design in the short amount of time that we had.

          Based on the research we collected from our client, the surveys, and the comparative features list, we created a feature prioritization chart using whiteboard and sticky notes to help group which features were high or low on the priority list. This also helped me narrow down on what features to design.

        We hosted a design studio at the Hazel Analytics headquarters to brainstorm ideas for the design of the onboarding process and default screens. I presented some preliminary sketches to the client so the client could get a sense of what they should be drawing. Together we discussed what potential features would be on the default screen. This included a streamlined onboarding experience and an intuitive default screen that would have some way to view insights, ranking, competitors, filtering, and news.

          We conducted 3 rounds of user testing. We conducted the 1st round of prototpying with paper cutouts and the 2nd and 3rd round with Figma. In every round, we gave each tester two different task scenarios and two tasks to complete for each.

          After paper prototypes, I began building a low fidelity version of the app in Figma. This covered the sign up and sign on process, restaurant entry and confirmation screens, single-unit dashboard screen, restaurant toggler (multi-unit view), and ability to add modules and filter information.

          In our final version of our prototype, I made changes to how information was presented in the onboarding, filtering, add module, and default view screens. One addition I made in the final design was a skippable walkthrough based off of the testing feedback. Color and iconography was based off of the client's style guide.

           We were only able to focus on a small aspect of the app despite the amount of research we did. This was mostly due to time and people. We also had a very limited pool of real users to test with because restaurant owners are generally busy people. More feedback from these type of users may have had an influence on my design direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given more time, I would've completed the prototype for the full experience. Testing with the complete prototype might have provided me with some valuable insights on the overall design, navigation, and experience.
