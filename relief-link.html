        <p>
          Relief Link is a homeless resource app which allows homeless people with mobile devices quickly find local resources. As part of General Assembly's hackathon, our team had two days to build a basic but functional app to showcase to judges. As the UX designer, my goal was to conduct research, iterate and test designs, and help facilitate development of the app with developers.

        <h5>Exploration</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our hackathon project had to solve an issue related to housing. Our team decided to focus on homelessness as a byproduct of housing because homelessness was a topic that we felt had a lot of information we could work with. Our team discovered that some of the homeless resource applications that exist today either targeted a particular homeless demographic (i.e. youth) or was not completely functional.

        <h5>Research</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
         Our team looked at the viability of a homeless resource application. We first conducted research regarding homeless smart phone ownership and learned that <a href="https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_18_147">over half a million people experience homelessness every night</a> (as of 2018). We also discovered that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22076445">62% of homeless youth own a smartphone</a>. Based on this, our team agreed that building a homeless resource app was feasible.

        <h5>Proto-Persona</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I came up with a proto-persona that encapsulates the needs and pain points of our users. Janice is a thirty-one year old homeless mother of two who uses her smart phone to search for food and nearby shelters. She tries to find the most reliable locations and is hesitant to travel to unsafe places unless she knows more information about it. How might we better serve Janice so that she is able to safely reach her destination for resources?

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Relief Link is an application which enables homeless people to locate local resources using their smart phone. We have observed that some homeless resource apps do not completely work or show the correct information. How might we improve the experience so that homeless people can safely and reliably obtain resources?

          <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>
            We believe by creating an intuitive and reliable resource application, homeless people will be able to reliably reach their destination to obtain resources.
            We will know this to be true when we see that users are successfully able to locate resources through the app.

        <h5>Prioritize Features</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team brainstormed a list of features for the app that would help our users find reliable locations for resources. This included a search bar, custom filters, resource voting, entry, validation, quick category filters, and site info. Due to time constraints, our team focused on developing the category filters and site info features as they address our persona's main concerns.

        <h5>Design Approach</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team discussed what types of categories were important for quick categories filters and decided on food, shelter, clothing, and medication as they are basic human needs. For the site info feature, our team agreed on creating a map screen where users click on a site of interest and a pop up message would appear displaying information about it. While the developers on our team started exploring existing APIs and coding the app, Alexis and I worked on coming up with sketches and designs of the filter categories and site info for prototype testing.

      <div class="left">
        <h3>Filter Categories</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Filter categories enable the user to quickly toggle between what they want to see on the map. We chose icons that best represented basic human needs - food, clothes, shelter, and medication with soup (soup kitchen), T-shirt, house, and health cross respectively.

        <h3>Site Info</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Clicking on specific points on the map will make a pop message appear which displays information such as site name, address, and phone number.

        <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          In the time that we had, our team conducted one round of usability testing with four different users on our paper prototype. I had test participants perform two tasks related to the filter categories and site info features. At the end of each test, we had users fill out a five question likert survey to gauge the app's intuitiveness.

        <h5>Test Findings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          We discovered through our findings that all of our test participants felt it was easy to use. However, two of our users struggled with deciphering what the icons meant in the category filters given the lack of labels. Users also mentioned that the user location icon on the map being too big which could obstructs sites of interest.

        <h5>Design Iterations</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team iterated on the designs to address user concerns from our test findings. Our next design iterations included labelling of the filter categories to make them more identifiable. Other changes included reducing the size of the user location icon to not block points of interest on the map. 
        </p>

        <h5>Final Product</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team managed to build the app with the features we planned on incoporating, but had to make a couple of exceptions. The developers on our team struggled to find the APIs for resource locations and had to resort to hardcoding the points of interest instead. Functionally it works, but no API was used. Because using an API was a requirement for the project, we came up short.
        </p>
      <div class="lrg-img">

        <h5>Next Steps</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
        The next step would be to test and iterate designs on additional features like the search bar, custom filters, resource voting, entry, and validation. We would also like to include additional categories and sites of interest such as men and women's shelter, domestic violence resources, veteran's aid, etc. In addition, we would also need to schedule time to test our designs with target users as soon as possible. Finally, our developers will need to search for APIs that would work for our app as we did not use one.

        <h5>Learnings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
        I learned that it was important to ask many questions and be vocal with your team especially when working with limited time. I also learned the value of  cross-functional collaboration. Even though our team came up with some great ideas that would have been nice to have in our app, we ultimately had to limit ourselves to a couple ideas because developers need time to code.
