        <p>
          Relief Link is a homeless resource app which allows homeless people with mobile devices quickly find local resources. As part of General Assembly's hackathon, our team had two days to build a basic but functional app to showcase to judges. As the user researcher, my goal was to conduct research, iterate & test designs, and help facilitate development of the app with developers.

        <p>
          Our team conducted research regarding homeless smart phone ownership and learned that <a href="https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_18_147">over half a million people experience homelessness every night</a> (as of 2018) and that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22076445">62% of homeless youth own a smartphone</a>.

          James is our proto-persona. He is a twenty-one year old homeless adult who uses his smart phone to search for food and nearby shelters. He is wary of unreliable sources and is hesitant to travel to unsafe locations unless he knows more information about it.

        <h5>Prioritize Features</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team brainstormed a list of features for the app that would allow homeless people find reliable locations for resources. This included a search bar, custom filters, resource voting, resource entry & validation, quick category filters, and site info. Due to time constraints, our team focused on developing the category filters and site info features as they address our persona's main concerns.

        <h5>Design Approach</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team discussed what types of categories were important for quick categories filters and decided on food, shelter, clothing, and medication as they are basic human needs. For the site info feature, our team agreed on creating a map screen similar to Waze where users click on a site of interest and a pop up message would appear displaying information about it. While the developers on our team started exploring existing APIs and coding some of the features, Alexis and I worked on coming up with sketches and designs of the filter categories and site info for prototype testing.

        <a>Filter Categories</a>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Filter categories enable the user to quickly toggle between what they want to see on the map. We chose icons that best represented basic human needs - food, clothes, shelter, and medication with soup (soup kitchen), T-shirt, house, and health cross respectively.

        <a>Site Info</a>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Clicking on specific points on the map will make a pop message appear which displays information such as site name, address, and phone number.

        <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          In the time that we had, Alexis and I conducted one round of usability testing with four different users on our paper prototype. I had test participants perform two tasks related to the filter categories and site info features. At the end of each test, we had users fill out a five question likert survey to gauge the app's intuitiveness. We discovered through our findings that all of our test participants felt it was easy to use. However, two of our users struggled with deciphering what the icons meant in the category filters given the lack of labels. Users also mentioned that the user location icon on the map being too big which obstructs other sites of interest.

        <h5>Design Iterations</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our interaction designer iterated on the designs to address user concerns from our test findings. Our second design iterations included labelling of the filter categories to make them more identifiable. Other changes included reducing the size of the user location icon to not block points of interest on the map.

        <h5>Next Steps</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
        The next step would be to test and iterate designs on additional features like the search bar, custom filters, resource voting, entry, and validation. We would also need to schedule time to test our iterations with target users. In addition, the developers will need to search for APIs that would work in our app as we did not use one.
