      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Relief Link is an app which helps homeless youth find shelters and resources more effectively. As part of General Assembly's hackathon, our team had twelve hours to build and showcase a functioning app. As the designer, <b>I conducted research, iterated & tested designs, and facilitated development of the app with developers</b>.

        <h5>Research Insights</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
         Our team first looked at the business viability of a resource locator app for the homeless. We conducted research regarding homeless smart phone ownership and learned that <a href="https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_18_147">over half a million people experience homelessness every night</a> (as of 2018) and that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22076445">62% of homeless youth own a smart phone</a>. Based on this, we were able to determine that a this app would have real value in the world.

        <h5>User Interviews & Proto-Persona</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          <b>Challenge:</b> Due to safety reasons and limited time we were unable to set up a time to interview our target users. As a result, the data documented from our interviews did not fully capture attitudes of our target demographic.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Decision Point</b>: I conducted three interviews with people on the street, asking them if they have had a history of homelessness or known anyone with experience. I then came up with a proto-persona that encapsulates the needs and pain points of our model user. Janice is a sixteen year old homeless girl who uses her smart phone to search for food and nearby shelters. She tries to find the most reliable locations and is hesitant to travel to unsafe places without knowing more information.

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          We have observed that many homeless youth are targeted because they are vulnerable. <b>How might we better serve homeless youth so that they can find shelters and resources more safely</b>? 
        </p>
      </div>

          <h5>Solution</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>
            <b>We believe by creating an intuitive and reliable resource application, homeless youth will be able to reliably obtain resources using their smart phone</b>. We will know this to be true when we see an increase in satisfaction, ratings, and downloads.

        <h5>Feature Prioritization</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team brainstormed a list of features for the app that would help our users find reliable locations for resources. This included a search bar, custom filters, resource voting, entry, validation, quick category filters, and site info. Because of limited time, <b>our team focused on developing the category filters and site info features as they were essential and low effort</b>.
        </p>

        <h5>Design Approach</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          While the developers on our team started exploring existing APIs and coding the app, my co-designer and I worked on coming up with sketches and designs of the filter categories and site info for prototype testing.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="contentblock">
      <div class="left">
        <h3>Filter Categories</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Filter categories enable the user to quickly toggle between what they want to see on the map. We chose icons that best represented basic human needs - food, clothes, shelter, and medication with the soup (soup kitchen), T-shirt, house, and health cross respectively.
        </p>
      <div class="sm-img">
        <img class="mtop100" src="images/relief_categories.png" alt="">

      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="contentblock">
      <div class="left">
        <h3>Site Info</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Clicking on specific points on the map will make a pop message appear which displays information such as site name, address, and phone number. 
        </p>
      <div class="sm-img">
        <img class="mtop50" src="images/relief_site_info.png" alt="">
      </div>

        <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          In the time that we had, our team conducted one round of usability testing with five different users on our paper prototype. I had test participants perform two tasks related to the filter categories and site info features. At the end of each test, we had users fill out a five question likert survey to gauge the app's intuitiveness.

        <h5>Test Findings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          We discovered through our findings that all of our test participants felt it was easy to use. However, two of our <b>users struggled with deciphering what the icons meant in the category filters given the lack of labels</b>. Users also mentioned that the <b>user location icon on the map being too big</b> which could obstruct sites of interest.
        </p>

        <h5>Design Iterations</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team iterated on the designs to address user concerns from our test findings. Our next design iterations included <b>labelling of the filter categories to make them more identifiable</b>. Other changes included <b>reducing the size of the user location icon</b> to not block points of interest on the map. 
        </p>
      <div class="lrg-img">

      <div class="left">
        <h5>Final Product</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
           Our team struggled to find the APIs for resource locations and had to resort to hardcoding the points of interest instead. This was due to the fact that not many APIs or data exist out there for homeless shelters. As a result, the final product ended up being more proof of concept than a functioning app.
        </p>
      <div class="lrg-img">

        <h5>Next Steps</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The next step would be to test and iterate designs on additional features like the search bar, custom filters, resource voting, entry, and validation. We would also like to include additional categories and sites of interest such as men and women's shelter, domestic violence resources, veteran's aid, etc. In addition, we would also need to schedule time to test our designs with target users as soon as possible. Finally, our developers will need to search for APIs that would work for our app as we did not use one.

        <h5>Learnings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Knowing how to pivot during any time during the project is important to learn as project parameters constantly change. Asking questions and being vocal with your team helps communicate ideas and gets the ball rolling. Recognizing what the team wants to accomplish versus what can be completed means more time doing and less time deliberating.
