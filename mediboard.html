          Medical information can be unorganized, unreliable, and difficult to understand. MediBoard's goal is to solve this problem using a data visualization tool to quantitatively compare medical treatments against conditions like depression, anxiety, and insomnia using real and up-to-date clinical trial data. As the Design Lead, <b>I led user story and persona development, conducted usability testing, and redesigned the web and mobile UI</b>.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team looked into the business viability of the visualization tool by exploring existing medical databases and registries such as <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> and <a href="https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/finding-clinical-trial">National Institutes of Health</a>. In addition, we spoke to multiple people on social media sites and network groups like Reddit and Facebook to gauge people's interest in the visualization tool.

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The goal of every medical site is to inform people. <b>However, people need up-to-date and trusted health information so they can make the best health decisions</b>. For patients and researchers, the main concern is the accuracy and reliability of information. <b>People need accurate medical information because they become frustrated if they are unable to obtain the right information</b>.

          <h5>Solution</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>
            <b>We believe implementing a data visualization tool that allows users to get accurate and reliable information will create a pleasant searching experience</b>. We will know this to be true when we see an increase in satisfaction and ratings.

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Because there are two different use cases for our tool, our team came up with the Studies and Compare Treatments pages. The <b>Studies page provides in-depth analysis</b> of each study while the <b>Compare Treatments page allows people to view conditions and compare different treatments</b>.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team conducted usability testings on the Studies and Compare Treatment pages with three average users and two researchers. In addition, I also conducted a SUS Survey to calculate the usability score.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Findings:</b> One major complaint users had was the amount of information on the Studies and Compare Treatment pages. Average users stated that there was a lot of unnecessary information and were mostly interested in the conditions, treatments, side effects, and people's experience with them. Reseachers mentioned that the information was making them think too hard and wished there was a way to view relevant studies and discuss them with others.

          Our team iterated on the designs to address user concerns from our test findings. Our goals for the next design iteration focused on condensing and restructuring the information so that it appears less overwhelming.

        <p>
          To determine how the information should be structured on the Studies page, our team conducted a card sorting activity using kardSort. From the ten responses we received, our team organized the content below based on the most popular groupings.

          The new Study page consists of <b>multiple sections that can be swapped between using tabs</b>. Each section houses information based on the results of the card sort. In addition, the <b>related studies and comments sections were added</b>.

          The new Compare Treatments page was redone to <b>show the most relevant information for the user such as the condition, treatment, side-effects, and comments</b>. The <b>demographics and studies sections were removed</b> in the new iteration as a result.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team interviewed a total of five users. At the end of the session I conducted a SUS Survey to calculate the usability score.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Findings:</b> Both user groups enjoyed the layout, infographics, and the ability to compare treatments. Users also stated that the side-effects feel easy to understand because they are color-coded by treatment and frequency. One user mentioned that the side-effects scare her a bit as a consumer but appreciates that the knowledge is there. Both user groups felt that switching between the section tabs was intuitive to use.

        <h5>Learnings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          <b>Don't take criticism to heart:</b> One important lesson I learned from this project is to treat criticism and negative responses from users as suggestion for how to improve designs for the target audience. In addition, accepting all kinds of feedback has allowed me to look at my designs from a different angle and try different approaches.
