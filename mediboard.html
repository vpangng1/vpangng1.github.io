          When it comes to medical information, they can be difficult to understand or look for. MediBoard is a data visualization tool to quantitatively compare medical treatments against conditions like depression, anxiety, and insomnia using real and up-to-date clinical trial data. As the designer, <b>I conducted research, iterated & tested designs, and facilitated development of the app with developers</b>.

         Our team looked into the business viability of this tool by exploring existing medical databases and registries such as <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> and <a href="https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/finding-clinical-trial">National Institutes of Health</a>. In addition, we spoke to multiple people on social media sites and network groups like Reddit and Facebook.

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The goal of every medical database is to inform people. <b>However, people need up-to-date information so they know the correct treatment and risks</b>. For people who research, practice, or use medicine, the main concern is the accuracy and reliability of information. <b>People need accurate medical information because they become frustrated if they receive the wrong diagnosis or medication</b>.

        <div class="right">
          <p>
            <b>We believe by creating a data visualization tool which allows users to get accurate and reliable information will create a pleasant searching experience</b>. We will know this to be true when we see an increase in satisfaction and ratings.

        <h5>Design Sketches & Ideation</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          While the developers on our team started exploring existing APIs and coding the app, my co-designer and I worked on coming up with sketches and designs of the filter categories and site info for prototype testing.
        </p>
      </div>

    <div class="contentblock">
      <div class="left">
        <h3>Filter Categories</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Filter categories enable the user to quickly toggle between what they want to see on the map. We chose <b>icons that best represented basic human needs - food, clothes, shelter, and medication</b> with the soup (soup kitchen), T-shirt, house, and health cross images respectively.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

        <h3>Site Info</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Clicking on specific points on the map will make a <b>pop message appear which displays information</b> such as site name, address, and phone number.

        <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          In the time that we had, our team conducted one round of usability testing with five different users on our paper prototype. I had test participants perform two tasks related to the filter categories and site info features. At the end of each test, we had users fill out a five question likert survey to gauge the app's intuitiveness.

        <h5>Test Findings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          We discovered through our findings that all of our test participants felt it was easy to use. However, two of our <b>users struggled with deciphering what the icons meant in the category filters given the lack of labels</b>. Users also mentioned that the <b>user location icon on the map being too big</b> which could obstruct sites of interest.
        </p>
      <div class="lrg-img">

        <h5>Design Iterations</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team iterated on the designs to address user concerns from our test findings. Our next design iterations included <b>labelling of the filter categories to make them more identifiable</b>. Other changes included <b>reducing the size of the user location icon</b> to not block points of interest on the map. 
        </p>
      <div class="lrg-img">

        <h5>Final Product</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
           Our team struggled to find the APIs for resource locations and had to resort to hardcoding the points of interest instead. This was due to the fact that <b>not many APIs or data exist out there for homeless shelters</b>. As a result, the <b>final product ended up being more proof of concept</b> than a functioning app.
        </p>
      <div class="lrg-img">
        <img class="mtop100" src="" alt="">

        <h5>Next Steps</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The next step would be to test and iterate designs on additional features like the search bar, custom filters, resource voting, entry, and validation. We would also like to include additional categories and sites of interest such as men and women's shelter, domestic violence resources, veteran's aid, etc. In addition, we would also need to schedule time to test our designs with target users as soon as possible. Finally, our developers will need to search for APIs that would work for our app as we did not use one.

        <h5>Learnings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Knowing how to pivot during any time during a project is important as project parameters constantly change. Asking questions and being vocal with your team helps communicate ideas and gets the ball rolling. Being able to decide early on what the team wants to accomplish versus what needs to be completed means less time deliberating and more time doing.
