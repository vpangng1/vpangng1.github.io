          Pink Gorilla Games is a Seattle-based retro and imported video game retailer that sells video games, books, clothing, collectibles, toys, edibles, and unique items. Inspired by Japanese game stores, PGG aims to be colorful, nostalgic, and fresh.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Inspired by Japanese game stores, PGG aims to be colorful, nostalgic, and fresh. What sets them apart from their competitors is their wide selection of merchandise, imported video games, knowledgeable staff, competitive pricing, and tight-knit consumer community. PGG also has a website for doing ecommerce, but their video game selection is curiously absent. PGG appeals to all generations of gamers and collectors.

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
           PGG proclaims to be the "coolest and fastest growing video game store in the world", but <b>users have a tough time navigating the website and getting a sense of what products are in store</b>.
        </p>

        <h5>Solution</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
           Creating a simple and organized way for users to see all online and in-store items while still having access to information about the nostalgic and vintage in-store experience.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Using a variety of methods including interviews, viewing reviews, and affinity mapping, I was able to extract key business and customer needs. These needs helped me understand about the problems and how I would approach them.

        <h3>Interviews</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          To kick off user discovery, I conducted interviews with five customers to learn about their motivations and reasons for coming to the store. Two customers I spoke up with said that they came to the store after <b>hearing good things from reviews and customers</b>. Another customer enjoyed the <b>friendly staff and atmosphere which is unlike any other game store</b>. Customers described the store as being very <b>clean, colorful, and organized</b>.
        </p>
        <!--<br>
        <p>
          I met with PGG's store manager to learn about more about the business. She stated that <b>the reason why they don't focus their efforts online is because the majority of their stock comes from customer trade-ins</b>. She mentioned that they once ran an experiment at their other store location where they sold their entire inventory online, but the store ended up closing because there was no longer any need for people to come in. However, <b>she acknowledged that having an strong online presence was important to promote business and invite new customers</b>.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
           From my research and findings, I mapped out the customer values and business goals. Customers of PGG want a <b>cool & fun experience as well as being able to learn more about the business</b>. Business goals of the organization include <b>inviting new customers while appealing to older generation of gamers</b>.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
           For the purposes of this project, I created two personas based on research and findings. Tiffany and John represent the younger and older generation gamer respectively. <b>Tiffany is someone who needs relationship with the brand</b> and keeps up with information through social media and reviews. On the other hand, <b>John Goodson needs trusting and intuitive services</b> that help him navigate products and items.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
            Before beginning the design process, I needed to first understand the full scope of the site redesign. To accomplish this, I researched PGG's existing site content and compared it with a few competitor websites.  
        </p>

        <h3>Competitve Analysis</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
            Content comparison helped me see the most common web content for video game stores such as game categories, about, reviews, news, etc. This exploration also helped me notice common naming and category organization conventions. I discovered that PGG's website lacks information about their business and that most of it can be found from outside sources.

           I mapped out the current site map of PGG's website. The existing site is disorganized, redundant, and misleading, making it difficult to navigate.

            I conducted a card sorting activity using Optimal Sort to see how users would organize the content and categories of the current website.

           The redesign is simplified for ease of searching and clarity. Content categories reflect common convention and user needs.

        <p>
           I created a new sitemap based on the results of the card sorting activity. 
           The About section contains information about the business and the team to help establish trust. News and Events inform people about what's new & cool to encourage new and existing customers to come check out the store.

           To increase visibility of all the available categories based on the site map, I placed the navigation categories (about, location, news, events) in the top right corner. Product categories were placed near the top center for easy and convenient access for the user regardless of page location.

          I gained a wealth of knowledge about the importance of talking with the business to explore their priorities and identity, including upper leadership, middle managers, and frontline staff. Balancing needs of both consumers and the business is critical to design viability.
