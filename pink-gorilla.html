          Pink Gorilla Games is a Seattle-based retro and imported video game retailer that sells video games, books, clothing, collectibles, toys, edibles, and unique items. PGG appeals to all generations of gamers and collectors. PGG proclaims to be the "coolest and fastest growing video game store in the world", but their website leaves a lot to be desired and is in need of a redesign.

        <h5>Exploration</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Inspired by Japanese game stores, PGG aims to be colorful, nostalgic, and fresh.  According to them, what sets them apart from their competitors is their wide selection of merchandise, imported video games, knowledgeable staff, competitive pricing, and tight-knit consumer community. I also discovered PGG also has a website for doing ecommerce, but their video game selection is curiously absent.

        <h5>Discovery</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I met with PGG's store manager to learn about more about the business and why they stopped selling video games on their website. She stated that the reason why they don't focus their efforts online is because the majority of their stock comes from customer trade-ins. She also mentioned that they once ran an experiment at their other store location where they sold their entire inventory online, but the store ended up closing because there was no longer any need for people to come in. PGG eventually removed their video game library from their website entirely to encourage more customers to come to the store. However, she acknowledged that having an strong online presence was important to promote business and invite new customers.

        <h5>Interviews</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
           I conducted interviews with customers around the store to learn about their motivations and reasons for coming to the store. I interviewed ten shoppers - one high school student, two college grads, one foreigner, a couple, and a family of four. I discovered most shoppers were middle-aged looking for rare video games as well as discontinued peripherals and exclusive commodities.

        <p>
           For the purposes of this project, my persona was already preassigned. I selected John Goodson as he best encapsulates the needs and concerns of the middle-aged shopper.

        <h5>Card Sorting</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
            I conducted a card sorting activity using Optimal Sort to see how users would organize the content and categories of the current website. One takeaway from this activity is that participants thought there should be less depth and more breath in its categories.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
           I created a proposed site map based on the results from the card sorting activity to address John's needs and concerns of quick access to information and navigation.

        <h5>Design Approach</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          In sticking with the idea of having less depth and more breadth, I tried to increase visibility of all the available categories based on the site map. I placed the header categories (about, contact, location, sign up, shopping cart, search field) near the top of the screen while the nav bar with the main categories were located below it.

        <h5>Testing & Iterations</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I conducted two rounds of usability testing with five users each. Users were asked to perform two scenarios. After which users shared specific feedback on the design. The designs were then iterated based on the user feedback.
