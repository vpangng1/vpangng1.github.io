          Pink Gorilla Games is a Seattle-based retro and imported video game retailer that sells video games, books, clothing, collectibles, toys, edibles, and unique  items. In addition to being able to buy, sell, and trade merchandise locally, PGG also has a website for doing online transactions. PGG proclaims to be the "coolest and fastest growing video games store in the world", but their website leaves a lot to be desired and is in need of a redesign.

          PGG appeals to all generations of gamers and collectors. Inspired by Japanese game stores, PGG aims to be colorful, nostalgic, and fresh. What sets them apart from their competitors is their wide selection of merchandise, imported video games, knowledgeable staff, and competitive pricing.

        <p>
          I met with PGG's store manager Kelsey Lewin to learn about more about the store and their website. Kelsey informed me that the reason why they don't focus their efforts online is because the majority of their stock comes from customer trade-ins. She also stated that they ran an experiment at their Bellevue location where they sold their entire inventory online, but the store ended up closing because there was no longer any need for people to come in. PGG eventually removed their video game section from their website to encourage customers to purchase and exchange items locally.

        <p>
          To kick off user discovery, I conducted five interviews with customers inside and outside the store to learn about their goals and motivations for coming to PGG. Ironically, out of the five customers I interviewed, only one customer was looking for video games. One customer was looking for stickers and a broken controller, while a family of four from Arizona were looking for rare video game peripherals. This showed me that
