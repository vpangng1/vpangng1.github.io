          Pink Gorilla Games is a Seattle-based retro and imported video game retailer that sells video games, books, clothing, collectibles, toys, edibles, and unique items. PGG appeals to all generations of gamers and collectors. Part of what makes PGG special is the "experience" of going to the store and looking at their merchandise. PGG proclaims to be the "coolest and fastest growing video game store in the world".

        <h5>Exploration</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Inspired by Japanese game stores, PGG aims to be colorful, nostalgic, and fresh.  What sets them apart from their competitors is their wide selection of merchandise, imported video games, knowledgeable staff, competitive pricing, and tight-knit consumer community. I also discovered PGG also has a website for doing ecommerce, but their video game selection is curiously absent.

        <h5>Discovery</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I met with PGG's store manager Kelsey Lewin to learn about more about the business and why they stopped selling video games on their website. Kelsey stated that the reason why they don't focus their efforts online is because the majority of their stock comes from customer trade-ins. She also mentioned that they once ran an experiment at their other store location where they sold their entire inventory online, but the store ended up closing because there was no longer any need for people to come in. PGG eventually removed their video game library from their website entirely to encourage more customers to come to the store. However, Kelsey acknowledged that having an strong online presence was important to promote business and invite new customers.

        <h5>Interviews</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
           I conducted interviews with customers around the store to learn about their motivations and reasons for coming to the store. I interviewed ten shoppers - one high school student, two college grads, one foreigner, a couple, and a family of four. I discovered most shoppers were middle-aged looking for rare video games as well as discontinued peripherals and exclusve commodities.

           For the purposes of this project, my persona was already preassigned. I selected John Goodson as he best encapsulates the needs and concerns of the middle-aged shopper.

        <h5>Card Sorting</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
            I conducted a card sorting activity with five users to understand how users would organize the elements of the website. The categories and content were based off of the informaton I gathered from the interviews.

        <p>
          I decided to redesign their e-commerce store to make it trusting and navigable, while also making sure PGG's core message was clearly communicated - to come to the store for the experience.
