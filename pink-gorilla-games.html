<h1> Interviews and Insights </h1>

<p>When I went to my client site (Pink Gorilla Games has two locations), I realized that my questions were too broad and had very little to do with their online presence. In retrospect, I should have tailored my questions more toward this. Regardless, I ended up creating an affinity diagram and one of the things I discovered was that many people appreciated how organized and clean the store was. 

I looked at designs and features from other websites like Gamestop, Amazon, and Newegg. One important insight that I discovered from my competitive analysis was that the website lacked any way of viewing or writing a review of their product. </p>

<h1>Persona and Context Scenario</h1>

<p>The persona that I chose to do was John Goodson. He was a tech savvy art teacher who wanted to find the right activities for his daughter. John Goodson’s key needs from the store included having quick access to a range of options, knowing what’s new on repeat visits, and a feeling of relationship with the brand. Pain points included difficult navigation, lack of sufficient product descriptions, and lack of trust with unfamiliar brands. Based on information about his persona and from my synthesis, I created a context scenario where John needed to find a reputable video game retailer where he could see the reviews of games on the e-commerce site and purchase and return games easily.</p>

<h1>Design and Iteration</h1>

<p>I decided to redesign their e-commerce store to make it easily navigable and organized like how the store was. I also decided to incorporate a feature to view and write reviews in my website redesign. One of the first things I did was redesign the sitemap of Pink Gorilla Game’s website. The current sitemap was messy and disorganized. It was not immediately apparent what the mission statement was and what the website was trying to do. In addition, some links from the side nav had nothing. After talking with the store owner, I determined that Pink Gorilla Games is all about Buying, Selling, and Trading. I made them the primary links on the home page. I put home, about, contact us, and events as the secondary nav in the top right corner. Everything else like FAQ, Return Policy, etc. I put in the footer. The end result is a site map that is more streamlined and less redundant. </p>




<h1>Prototyping and Usability Test</h1>

<p>I conducted 5 usability tests with 5 different users. I tasked them with checking out and purchasing a game from the website. Every user successfully performed this task, but had feedback about the cosmetic details of the site. These include:

Making the menu catalog window bigger
Relocating social media icons
Expand on the shipping and billing options
Needs more validation when an item was added to the cart (current problem was that updating the cart with a number next to it wasn’t enough to convey to the user that an item was added)

I addressed all these on my 2nd iteration by first making the catalog menu bigger. I moved the social media icons in the footer. I included additional shipping options in the shipping and payment screen.  To address with validation, when the user added an item to the cart, it would take them directly to the shopping cart. </p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>As a result of spending too much time on my wireframes, I had only done one round of usability testing and two iterations of my designs. In retrospect, I should have spent more time conducting usability tests and less time worrying about the details of the wireframes. What was not shown during my presentation was that I actually did some sketches in Balsamiq. I think I should’ve also conducted usability tests with paper prototypes and Balsamiq earlier.</p>

<h1>Next Steps</h1>

<p>The next steps of this project would be to create sketches for Trade and Sell options on the website. Also on the product and detailed product pages, I would need to figure out and test with users whether it would be a good idea to have the ratings on the product page or detailed product pages.</p>

        <p>
          Hazel Analytics is a food tech company specializing in food safety analytical software that they market to restaurants to drive business growth and provide business insights. As part of our client project at General Assembly, I worked as the Interaction Designer tasked with creating an interactive prototype on the iPad platform. Given that we only had 3 weeks, our team, consisting of myself, the Project Manager, and the UX Researcher, focused on the onboarding experience.

        <p>
          Restaurant owners need a simple way to stay prepared and informed about food safety to help them and their staff plan efficiently and effectively for health department inspections.

            Focusing on the default view, customizable dashboard, and the onboarding experience of the app will help restaurant owners better prepare for future health inspections with useful insights whilst also providing them with an overall intuitive experience.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I conducted a comparative analysis on existing apps in the food safety space to discover common features. These included the ability to share information, get help, and visualize data. Even though our topic was very niche, we took notes from existing features in similar apps to help with feature prioritization.

          We discovered through affinity mapping that single and multi restaurant owners had different motivations and attitudes toward food safety inspection. This led to the creation of two different user personas. From a design perspective, this meant creating two different designs.

         Using Optimal Workshop, we were able to map out the architecture and sitemap. This allowed me hone in on the MVP and know what to design in the short amount of time that we had.

          Based on the research we collected from our client, the surveys, and the comparative features list, we created a feature prioritization chart using whiteboard and sticky notes to help group which features were high or low on the priority list. This also helped me narrow down on what features to design.

        We hosted a design studio at the Hazel Analytics headquarters to brainstorm ideas for the design of the onboarding process and default screens. I presented some preliminary sketches to the client so the client could get a sense of what they should be drawing. Together we discussed what potential features would be on the default screen. This included a streamlined onboarding experience and an intuitive default screen that would have some way to view insights, ranking, competitors, filtering, and news.

          We conducted 3 rounds of user testing. We conducted the 1st round of prototpying with paper cutouts and the 2nd and 3rd round with Figma. In every round, we gave each tester two different task scenarios and two tasks to complete for each.

          After paper prototypes, I began building a low fidelity version of the app in Figma. This covered the sign up and sign on process, restaurant entry and confirmation screens, single-unit dashboard screen, restaurant toggler (multi-unit view), and ability to add modules and filter information.

          In our final version of our prototype, I made changes to how information was presented in the onboarding, filtering, add module, and default view screens. One addition I made in the final design was a skippable walkthrough based off of the testing feedback. Color and iconography was based off of the client's style guide.

           We were only able to focus on a small aspect of the app despite the amount of research we did. This was mostly due to time and people. We also had a very limited pool of real users to test with because restaurant owners are generally busy people. More feedback from these type of users may have had an influence on my design direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given more time, I would've completed the prototype for the full experience. Testing with the complete prototype might have provided me with some valuable insights on the overall design, navigation, and experience.
