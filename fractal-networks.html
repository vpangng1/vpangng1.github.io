          Fractal Link is a computer application that allows users to safely publish websites, services, and applications from their personal computer. Fractal Link works with another application called <b>Docker which "containerizes" applications to make them easier to create, deploy, and share with others</b>. As the designer for the team, <b>I was brought on to create visual assets and the UI for the website</b>.

          Our user research team discovered from interviews and internet sources that the target audience are <b>users who have varying levels of self-hosting and Docker experience</b>. In addition, based on survey results, our team identified four primary reasons users want to self-host.

          Using existing research that my team previously conducted, our team was able to craft two different peronas which represent our model users.

The other user, <b>Greg, is an experienced user who wants to expand his self-hosting network</b>.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          From looking at other competitor sites, we discovered that most of them had a <b>call-to-action feature on the landing page</b> that allowed users to get a feel of the product. We decided to <b>base our design around this using a feature called the configurator</b> that requested certain information from the user such as domain name, service name and port. This would generate a piece of code inside the configurator where the user would then <b>copy and paste it into their own Docker file</b>.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team conducted testings on the team's staging website with two advanced users and two new users. I created a script to help guide me through the testing and recorded their responses using voice recording software on my mobile device. At the end of the test <b>I also conducted a SUS Survey to calculate the usability score</b>.

        <br>
        <!--<p>
          <b>Decision Point</b>: One of the early issues I ran into was trying to recruit users who had experience using docker through surveys, social media, etc. Our team decided that it was appropriate to use people who were not familiar with docker as they were closer to our model user Chris. 
        </p>
        <br>-->
        <p>
          <b>Findings:</b> Both new users expressed confusion with regard to the configurator and had trouble figuring out where to find the information it was requesting for. Advanced users understood how to use the configurator but wanted to see a live demo of a working application.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our design team processed the feedback from our usability testings to develop design iterations to address user concerns. <b>Our two goals for the next iteration were to rework the configurator and add a live demo feature</b>.

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          In the next iteration, the configurator was completely overhauled so that all users had to do was copy the code that was already on the screen and paste it in their Docker file. When the visitor came to the site, the <b>configurator would automatically generate a code using information from the visitor's computer browser</b>. This code was different for every visitor that went to the site and <b>eliminated the need for user input</b>.

        <p>
          To address concerns for a live preview, our design team added <b>working demos of applications on the landing page</b>. This worked similarly to the configurator where the user copied the code to their own Docker file, but an instance of the program which was already configured would be available when the user launched the Docker application.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
           The second round of testing was done on the team's staging site based on the Adobe XD's sketches. Our team interviewed five users with different levels of Docker experience. At the end of the test I also conducted a SUS Survey to calculate the usability score.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Findings:</b> While three out of our five users had little difficulty with using the configurator or demo, inexperienced users still found the overall process of copying and pasting the code into their Docker file somewhat difficult and confusing. Users also wished that there was clear cut instructions on how to use the configurator and install apps.

          In the next iteration, the <b>configurator on the landing page was replaced with a packaged install file</b>.

        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Findings:</b> Users who were new or had little to no experience with Docker greatly enjoyed installing apps through the install file method and thought the process was intuitive.

          <b>Understand your audience:</b> One important lesson I learned was to not assume that everyone knows how to do something even when instructed. People have different levels of subject knowledge and experience. As a result some people need more guidance than others. In addition, it is necessary to be patient and take notes as much as possible.
        </p>
        <!--<br>
        <p>
          <b>Follow design standards:</b> I've learned to stick to the design guidelines that have already been established in place in order to keep things consistent across the team. Working within the constraints also allowed me to focus on the objectives at hand and not stray too far from the project goals.
