          Fractal Link is a piece of software designed for people to do self-hosting using their own home computer and network. It is an alternative to third-party services and providers that host people's data like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. Fractal Link does this by leveraging existing self-hosting and virtualization technologies such as Docker. As the designer for this role, <b>I was brought on to create visual assets and the UI for the website</b>.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Using existing research that my team previously conducted, I was able to craft two different peronas which represent our model users. Our first model user, <b>Chris, is someone who wants to do self-hosting but is unsure where to start</b>. The other user, <b>Greg, is someone who has experience self-hosting and wants to be able to share and self host easier</b>.

        <p>
           The goal of Fractal Link is to provide an alternative to hosting that is affordable and accessible to everyone. <b>How do we create an experience that caters to both new and advanced users that isn't confusing or frustrating?</b>

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Early concept sketches were done in Balsamiq for convenience. From looking at other competitor sites, we discovered that <b>most of them had some demo or feature on the landing page</b> that allowed users to get a feel of the product. <b>We decided to base our design around this using a feature called the configurator</b> that took in information from the user. This would generate a file where the user would then copy and paste the file into their own Docker file.

        <h5>Initial Testing & Findings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team conducted testings on the team's staging website with two advanced users and two new users. I created a script to help guide me through the testing and recorded their responses using voice recording software on my mobile device. At the end of the test I also conducted a SUS Survey to calculate the usability score.
        </p>
        <br>
        <!--<p>
          <b>Decision Point</b>: One of the early issues I ran into was trying to recruit users who had experience using docker through surveys, social media, etc. Our team decided that it was appropriate to use people who were not familiar with docker as they were closer to our model user Chris. 
        </p>
        <br>-->
        <p>
          <b>Findings:</b> Both new users expressed confusion with regard to the configurator and had trouble figuring out where to find the information it was requesting for. Advanced users understood how to use the configurator but wanted to know what additional features were available. In addition, they stated it would be useful if they could get a live demo or preview.

        <h5>Design Iteration & Visual Design</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our design team processed the feedback from our usability testings to develop design iterations to address user concerns. <b>Our two goals for the next iteration were to rework the configurator and add a live demo feature</b>.

        <h3>Configurator</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          In the next iteration, the configurator was completely overhauled so that all <b>users had to do was copy the code that was already on the screen and paste it in their docker file</b>. When the visitor came to the site, the browser in the background would automatically generate a code inside the configurator using information from the visitor's computer. This code was different for every visitor that went to the site and <b>eliminated the need for user input</b>.

        <h3>Live Demo</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          To address concerns for a live preview, our design team <b>added demos of programs like Minecraft and WordPress on the landing page</b>. This worked similarly to the configurator where the user copied the file to their own computer, but an instance of the program which was already configured would be available when the user launched the docker application.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
           The second round of testing was done on the team's staging site based on the Adobe XD's sketches. Our team interviewed five users with different levels of docker experience. At the end of the test I also conducted a SUS Survey to calculate the usability score.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Findings:</b> While three out of our five users had little difficulty with the configurator or demo, inexperienced users still found the overall process of copying and pasting the file on their computer somewhat difficult and confusing, especially if they have no docker experience.

          The goal for the next iteration was to <b>simplify the process of installing application by eliminating steps for new users while preserving the traditional method for advanced users</b>.

        <p>
          In the next iteration, the configurator was scrapped in favor of a packaged install file. When the user opened the download file, the program would install the app and docker if it wasn't already installed. Advanced users could still install apps using the command line interface and a page for new people who wanted to install apps the traditional way was provided.

        <p>
          <b>Findings:</b> Users who were new or had little to no experience with docker greatly enjoyed the app catalog and thought installing docker/apps was intuitive.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          <b>Understand your audience:</b> One important lesson I learned was to not assume that everyone knows how to do something even when instructed. People have different levels of subject knowledge and experience. As a result some people need more guidance than others. In addition, it is necessary to be patient and take notes as much as possible.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Follow design standards:</b> I've learned to stick to the design guidelines that have already been established in place in order to keep things consistent across the team. Working within the constraints also allowed me to focus on the objectives at hand and not stray too far from the project goals.
