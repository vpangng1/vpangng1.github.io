           Puget Sound Trip Planner is a trip planning app that allows users to plan trips, locate bus stops, and view departure times within the Puget Sound region. However, with an <b>average score of 1.9 out of 5</b>, there was room for improvement in terms of design, features, and the overall experience. As the user researcher, my goal was to find out what kind of problems the app was facing and then work with the team to propose changes that would address these issues.

        <h5>Research Insights</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p class="mbot100">
          I conducted some preliminary research on what users were already saying about Trip Planner in the app store. Feedback from the app was generally negative, with users citing numerous issues such as frequent crashing, unreliable bus time information, and broken features. I also discovered that the app does not have a home screen (it automatically defaults to the categories screen) and navigating to simple features such as a map can take around twenty seconds with loading and latency.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team conducted a competitive analysis chart to see how Trip Planner fares against our trip planning apps and how they stay competitive. We found that Trip Planner has nothing in common with other popular trip planning apps which have a visible map, home map screen, and minimal depth. However, we discovered that <b>Trip Planner has a unique alerts feature not seen in other competitive apps</b> that provides users information when bus routes are changed due to weather, road work, etc.

        <p>
          I created and sent out an open-response survey through Facebook, Slack, Craigslist, and Reddit to reach out to target users and also understand what were the most important factors when using the trip planning app. From the responses I received, I discovered that users wanted <b>simple and intuitive navigation</b> as well as <b>accurate information</b>.

        <h5>User Interviews</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I conducted six qualitative interviews with target users to kick off user discovery. Our team then analyzed the findings from the interviews to define the problem Trip Planner users were facing. The results of our research are as follows:
        </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Users mentioned that the app was not intuitive to use and should feel more like Google Maps and Cityplanner.</li>
            <br>
            <li>All six interviewees used multiple transporation applications for a specific purpose or feature. In this case, Trip Planner was only used for the notification feature.</li>
            <br>
            <li>There were concerns from over half of the interviewees that information may not be accurate.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Interview Findings</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          We discovered that users used Trip Planner primarily to see if there are changes to their normal buses and bus routes, but felt the app was too complicated to navigate compared to more popular apps such as Google Maps, Citymapper, etc. Users told us it was faster to access all their trip planning information from other apps.

          <p>
            Madison Maley is our user persona. She is a twenty year old college student who uses multiple trip planning apps to get around the city and hang out with friends after work. She checks Trip Planner to get notifications about her bus routes, but uses other trip planning apps for everything else. We can serve Madison by making Trip Planner easier to use so she only needs to rely on one app.

        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>
             Trip Planner was designed to be the go to trip planning app for the Puget Sound region. We have observed that the app's wide breadth of categories is creating a sense of lostness and confusion, causing users to seek alternate options. How might we improve navigation and engagement of the app so that users are more satisifed with its service?

        </div>

      <div class="contentblock">

        </div>
        <div class="right">          
          <p>
             We believe that reorganizing the categories and content in Trip Planner will create an intuitive experience for users, increasing user engagement. We will know we're right when we see an increase in downloads, satisfaction, and ratings.

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          To help with reorganizing the content in the app, our team conducted a card sorting activity with people to create a proposed site map. As a team, we managed to condense the categories down from seven to four. By reducing the amount categories, we improve the navigability of the app, therefore making it more intuitive for Madison to use.

        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>
            Our team conducted a brainstorming session to generate design ideas and concept sketches for the home screen, tab navigation bar, filters, and alerts features to make sure they can be intuitively navigated. One key takeaway from this was deciding to place the filter location next to the search instead of in settings as originally proposed in our proposed site map.

          <p>
            As a team we evaluated all of our research and prioritized the features we were going to address for improvement in our redesign. The redesign includes features and characteristics that Madison wants to see, such as easy navigation and reliable information on buses and schedules. The rationale behind starting our designs at high-fidelity was to give users a realistic idea of what the app would look like and get more accurate feedback from testers. Our interaction designer proposed designing the folllowing wireframes to address our persona's needs:

        <h3>Home Screen Map</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          A big map was added to the home screen. This was done to cut down on unnecessary time and effort to access certain information, in this case the map. The addition of the map home screen also increases its resemblance to other competitor apps, therefore making it more intuitive to use. Users can select specific points of interest on the map like bus stops for easy access to information like bus routes, schedules, etc.

        <h3>Tab Navigation Bar</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The tab navigation bar was added to the bottom of the screen to make features quickly accessible wherever Madison is in the app - cutting down on unnecessary time and effort. Having all the categories on one screen also aligns with Madison's need for simple and intuitive navigation.

        <h3>Filters</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The filters feature is located next to the search address and destination field for convenient access. In the filter screen, users can easily toggle what they want to see on the map like ferries, trains, light rail, etc.

        <h3>Alerts</h3>

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The alerts feature allows Madison to know ahead of time when bus routes are changed or delayed while also addressing her need for accurate and reliable information. Users can find information about a particular route by clicking on the route that has the alert icon on it. Alerts were added in the route selection screen so users could see all notifications related to that particular route. This also eliminated the need for a dedicated category. Lastly, the alerts feature increases engagement with users since it is unique to Trip Planner.

          I created a user testing script which had test participants perform different tasks to gauge the app's intuitiveness and usability. These tasks included:

        <br>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Searching for bus routes to a specific location</li>

          I conducted three rounds of user testing in our InVision prototype. A total of eleven users participated in our study. The results from our testing are as follows:

       <!-- <br>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Testers expected to find locations in recent searches for convenience. In addition, users were also confused with which icon represents what on the map screen.</b></li>

      <h3>1st Round Findings</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          We discovered from our first round of testing that all test participants felt the home screen map and persistent tab navigation bar intuitive to use, likening it to Google Maps and Apple Maps. However we noticed that two out of three testers found it more natural to locate filters under settings than in the search field. We also learned that testers also felt discouraged from the clicking on the route with the alert icon in the route selection screen because they either didn't know what it was or thought it meant they shouldn't click on it. This was the opposite reaction we were expecting and our interaction designer made changes in the next iteration to make it more inviting in order to solve Madison's need for up-to-date information about changes and delays to her usual bus routes.

      <h3>2nd Round Findings</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          During our second round of testing, we noticed that half of our users went to the search field first instead of going to settings. One of four testers suggested having a text bubble to indicate where filters are for users using it for the first time since some of filters were already toggled on by default. We also noted that all of our testers expected to find locations in recent searches. Since recent searches is supposed to cut down on time and effort for Madison to access information, our interaction designer included this under the favorites category in the next iteration. Lastly, we learned that users were getting confused with which icon represents what on the map, so the iconography was reworked in the next iteration to address Madison's need of accurate and reliable information.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
         During our third round of testing, two out of four testers were able to navigate to the filters to complete the assigned task, but found it slightly unintuitive to have filters in settings. Other small complaints included the size of text and the search bar being too small. Our interaction designer took these findings and made changes accordingly.

        The next step would be to take a deeper look at where filters should be located in the redesign due to mixed responses and feedback. In addition, I would also want to look into how our team can increase user engagement of the alerts feature. I would also want to conduct a SUS survey to gauge the intuitiveness of our redesign. Other considerations include exploring features in visual design.

        I believed our team should have started prototyping with low-fidelity designs first. Because we jumped to high-fidelity designs, this made it harder to pin-point issues that could’ve been related to the core of the design rather than specific features. As a result, we were confined to a specific design which made it hard to pivot. I learned that it was important to test designs with more users as three to four was not enough to make conclusions. In addition, I felt it was a mistake that we moved the filters option from the settings category as outlined originally in our proposed site map early. Even though card sorting participants felt filters belonged in settings, we moved it to the search field area early on in our redesign.
