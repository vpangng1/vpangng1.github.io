        <p>
           Puget Sound Trip Planner is a trip plannng app that allows users to plan trips, locate bus stops, and view departures within the Puget Sound region. However, with an <b>average score of 1.9 out of 5</b>, there was room for improvement in terms of design, features, and the overall experience. As the user researcher, my goal was to find out what kind of problems the app was facing and then work with the team to propose changes that would address these issues.

        <h5>Reseach & Analysis</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I conducted preliminary research on what users were saying about Trip Planner in the app store. Users cited numerous issues such as frequent crashing, unreliable bus time information, and broken features. However, users praised its unique alert feature that notifies users when bus routes are cancelled or when buses stop runnng due to weather, road work, etc. We discovered through competitive analysis that this alert feature is not seen in any other trip planning app.

        <h5>Interviews & Affinity Mapping</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I conducted six twenty-minute qualitative interviews with a set list of questions to kick off user discovery. Afterward our team explored the findings from the interviews to define the problem Trip Planner users were facing. We discovered through our findings that users  used Trip Planner primarily to see if there are changes to their buses and bus routes, but used other trip planning apps for everything else because they were easier to use.

        <div class="right">
          <p>
            Madison Maley is our user persona. She is a 20 year old college student who uses multiple trip planning apps to get around the city and meet up with friends after school. She checks Trip Planner to get notification and alerts about her bus routes, but uses other apps to plan her trips. We can serve Madison by making Trip Planner more user-friendly so she only needs to rely on one app.

          <h5>Problem & Hypothesis</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
         
          <p>
             Trip Planner was designed to be the go to trip planning app for the Puget Sound region. We have observed that the wide breadth of categories and disorganized content are causing distrust with users, leading them to turn away from it. How might we make the app more trustworthy and engaging for users?
          </p>
          
          <p>
             We believe that reorganizing the structure and layout of Trip Planner so that it follows the design patterns of other reputable trip planning apps will create a familiar experience, resulting in better trust and engagement. We will know we're right when we see an increase in overall user satisfaction.

          <h5>Design Approach</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>
            As a team we evaluated all of our research and prioritized the features we were going to address for improvement. Our interaction designer, Leah Morales developed the following wireframes to propose new solutions.

          <h1><b>Map Home Screen & Tab Navigation</b></h1>
          <p>
            Our team created a map section on the home screen with tab bar navigation to reduce the amount of steps needed to access the map screen and other features.
          </p>
        <div class="lrg-img">
        <img class="mtop100 mbot100" src="" alt="">
        </div>
        <h1><b>Filters</b></h1>
           <p>
            The filters section was redesigned to allow users to quickly toggle between what they want to see and not see on the map.
           </p>
        <div class="lrg-img">
        <img class="mtop100 mbot100" src="" alt="">
        </div>
        <h1><b>Alerts & Notification Feature</b></h1>
           <p>
            The main appeal of the app - this feature was added in the route selection screen so that users could see notifications and alerts for that particular route.
           </p>

        <h5>Strategic Analysis</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Users suggested that Puget Sound Trip Planner would be more intuitive if it followed some design patterns of their favorite apps. In response to this, my team took a look at competitors app layouts and paid close attention to the apps mentioned in user interviews (Google, Apple, and One Bus Away). My discovery was that these more popular apps had a map on the home screen as well as minimal navigation. Puget Sound Trip Planner has an unwelcoming interface and is not intuitive to use. The app has a map which allows to find your destination relative to where you are, but it took some additional navigation to get to that feature.
        </p>

        <p>To find out better who my users were and what their needs and wants were, we went out and asked people near bus stops and public locations about what kind of mobile transportation app they used. These people ranged from students to working adults. Based on the research we collected, we discovered 6 out of 7 people we tested used 2 or more transportation apps for specific purposes. For example, people used Google Maps because it is easy and intuitive to find directions. However, at an actual bus stop, people would utilize One Bus Away because it provided them with real time information of when the bus would arrive. Google Maps does not always provide reliable or real time information. </p>

        <h5>Takeaway</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <!--<p>I thought that we should have started our first design iterations on paper or at low fidelity even though I understood the argument of making things more detailed to assist with user guidance. We jumped to mid-fidelity using Sketch and inVision. As a result, this made it harder to pin-point issues that could’ve been related to the core of the design rather than the specific features. Because we started with a mid fidelity design, we were confined to it. I felt that was evidently the case during our three usability tests. The feedback we received from the users was largely inconsistent.</p>

        <p>I also should have interviewed people that used Puget Sound Trip Planner. While I tried to see if the people I interviewed had used this specific app before during my user interviews, I admit I did not exercise all communication channels to see if other people had used Puget Sound Trip Planner app. This was largely due to the time. This resulted in borrowing design ideas and getting inspiration from other apps rather than focusing on what to specifically fix based on the existing Puget Sound Trip Planner app. </p>
        
        <p>I think we did a good job with our presentation in terms tying in our user persona. We constantly communicated what we were going to do and delivered a prototype that was extremely detailed.</p>-->
