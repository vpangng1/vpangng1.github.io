           Puget Sound Trip Planner is a trip planning app that allows users to plan trips, locate bus stops, and view departure times within the Puget Sound region. However, with an <b>average score of 1.9 out of 5</b>, there was room for improvement in terms of design, features, and the overall experience. As the user researcher, <b>my goal was to find out what kind of problems the app was facing and then work with the team to propose changes that would improve the app's popularity, usability, and rating. </b>

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The goal of every public transit app is to provide commuters information about how to get from their starting location to their destination. <b>However, commuters need the most up-to-date information so they can plan their trips more effectively</b>. For people who take public transit, the main concern is with the accuracy and reliability of arrival times. <b>Regular commuters need reliable information on their bus routes because they become frustrated if they are unable to tell when their bus arrives</b>.

        <p>
          <b>We believe implementing a instantaneous bus tracking feature in the app which displays accurate and reliable information will ease frustration, therefore creating a pleasant experience for the user</b>.

        <p class="mbot50">
          As the user researcher, I sought to understand the current state of the app and the user's attitudes related to Puget Sound Trip Planner. I first looked at what users were already saying about Trip Planner in the Apple Store and Google Play. Feedback from the app was generally negative, with users citing numerous issues such as <b>unreliable bus time information, long loading times, broken features, and unintuitive interface</b>.

        <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team conducted a competitive analysis chart to see how Trip Planner fares against our trip planning apps and how they stay competitive. We found that Trip Planner has very little in common with other popular trip planning apps which have a visible map, home map screen, minimal depth, and real-time tracking. However, we discovered that <b>the app has a unique alerts feature not seen in other competitive apps that provides users real-time information</b> when bus routes are changed due to weather, road work, etc.

        <h5>User Surveys</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          To kick off user discovery, I sent out two separate surveys through social media to understand our target users better. The first survey asked users what they considered to be important factors when selecting and using a transit app. The second survey asked users about their frequency and method of public transportation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Survey Findings:</b> From the fifteen responses I received, I discovered the majority of our users prioritized reliability, accuracy, and real-time information. In addition, I also found that 54% of my participants used public transportation only 5 days a week and 42% used buses to commute. Based on these results, I was comfortable narrowing users for this redesign to King County residents who utilize public buses for commuting.

        <h5>User Interviews & Synthesis</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          <b>Challenge:</b> Our team had difficulties defining the actual user problems involved with using the current app due to limited time and difficulty finding users who used it. After consulting with industry experts, it was noted that there likely was not enough data to infer a problem statement. The quotes documented from my research did not seem to fully capture attitudes of current users, just commuters in general who may use other transit apps.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          <b>Decision Point:</b> I conducted eleven interviews with commuters around bus stops and public places during peak hours, asking them a set of questions like what transit apps they currently use as well as their needs and pain points. 
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          <b>Interview Findings:</b> All eleven interviewees used multiple transit apps such as Google Maps, Citymapper, Apple Maps, Moovit, One Bus Away, etc. There were also concerns from over half of the interviewees that information may not always be accurate. Through affinity mapping and user synthesis, we discovered that several of the users that we interviewed were students who use transit apps to get to and from internships and classes. They have busy schedules and cannot afford to be late. As a result, <b>they require the most accurate and up-to-date information about their routes</b>.

        <div class="right">
          <p>
            I created our persona Madison Maley who encapsulates our user's behaviors, motivations, needs, and pain points. She has the desire to balance her work and social life with frequent trips to yoga and dinner with her friends, but needs the ease of being able to find her way home from wherever she finds herself after work. Like most of our users, she currently uses transit apps to navigate around the city and plan her trips, but wants something that will give her more Seattle-focused routes and real-time information.

          <p>
            As a team we evaluated all of our research and prioritized the features we were going to address for improvement in our redesign. Our interaction designer created the following mid-to-high fidelity wireframes which includes features and characteristics that Madison wants to see such as easy navigation and reliable information on buses and schedules. The rationale behind <b>starting our designs at higher fidelity was to give users a realistic idea of what the app would look like and get more accurate feedback from testers</b>.

        <h5>User Scenario & Testing</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I conducted three rounds of user testing in our InVision prototype with a total of eleven users participants. The user scenario was for the user to locate the yoga studio from their current location in the prototype. These tasks included searching for bus routes to a specific location and finding real-time information about the bus schedule.
        </p>
      </br>
        <p>
          <b>Challenge:</b> Throughout our rounds of testing, we received mixed feedback from testers regarding where certain features should be located. Users also had different ways of navigating the app to look for directions which led to points of frustration and confusion that I observed from the tester. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Decision Point:</b> Based on the results of the usability tests, our interaction designer made changes in the next iterations that would make looking for information easier such as adding a recent searches category and walkthrough indicators.

        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>
            Throughout our tests I used System Usability Survey (SUS) scores to gauge the usability and intuitiveness of our prototype. I processed the numbers from the first round of testing on the initial wireframes to the last round we did on the hi-fi designs. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <b>Test Findings:</b> Though we only saw a two point difference, one important thing to note was that all users we tested with were not representative of our target user who used Trip Planner. I believe the results would have been much different had we tested with users of the current app.

        <h5>Learnings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          <b>Anticipate your target users:</b> One of struggles on this project was finding our target users. When working with unpopular apps, I completely underestimated how difficult it was to recruit them. Though I did tap into many social media channels, in retrospect, I should've incentivized this or expected this outcome more. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Stick to lower fidelity first:</b> I believed our team should have started prototyping with low-fidelity designs first. Because we jumped to high-fidelity designs, this made it harder to pin-point issues that could’ve been related to the core of the design. As a result, we were confined to a specific design which made it hard to pivot. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Test with more users:</b> I learned that it was important to test designs with more users as three to four was not enough to make conclusions. This was especially the case on this project as we were getting inconsistent feedback throughout the testing.
