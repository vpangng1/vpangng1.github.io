           Puget Sound Trip Planner is a trip plannng app that allows users to plan trips, locate bus stops, and view departure times within the Puget Sound region. However, with an <b>average score of 1.9 out of 5</b>, there was room for improvement in terms of design, features, and the overall experience. As the user researcher, my goal was to find out what kind of problems the app was facing and then work with the team to propose changes that would address these issues.

        <h5>Reseach & Analysis</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I conducted some preliminary research on what users were saying about Trip Planner in the app store. Users cited numerous issues such as frequent crashing, unreliable bus time information, and broken features. However, users praised its unique notification feature that provides users information when bus routes are changed due to weather, road work, etc. We discovered through competitive analysis that this notification feature is not seen in any other trip planning app.

        <h5>Interviews</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I conducted six qualitative interviews with target users to kick off user discovery. Our team then analyzed the findings from the interviews to define the problem Trip Planner users were facing. We discovered through our findings that users used Trip Planner primarily to see if there are changes to their normal buses and bus routes, but felt the app had too much information to navigate through for everything else. Users told us it was faster to access all their trip planning information from other apps such as Google Maps, One Bus Away, etc.

          <p>
            Madison Maley is our user persona. She is a twenty year old college student who uses multiple trip planning apps to get around the city and hang out with friends after work. She checks Trip Planner to get notifications about her bus routes, but uses other trip planning apps for everything else. We can serve Madison by making Trip Planner easier to use so she only needs to use one app.

        <div class="right">
         
          <p>
             Trip Planner was designed to be the go to trip planning app for the Puget Sound region. We have observed that the app's wide breadth of categories is creating a sense of lostness and confusion, causing users to seek alternate options. How might we improve navigation and engagement of the app so that users are more satisifed with its service?

        </div>
        <div class="right">          
          <p>
             We believe that reorganizing the categories and content in Trip Planner will create an intuitive experience for users, increasing user engagement. We will know we're right when we see an increase in user satisfaction with the app.

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
         To help with reorganizing the content in the app, our project manager, Charlotte Hulseman conducted a card sorting activity with people to create a proposed site map. We managed to condense the categories down from seven to four.

          <p>
            Our team performed a design studio to come up with some ideas and concept sketches for the home screen and tab navigation bar. As a team we discussed where we would put the filter feature in the app because we believed it was a feature users would see when searching for a route rather than being under settings.

            As a team we evaluated all of our research and prioritized the features we were going to address for improvement. Our interaction designer, Leah Morales developed the following wireframes to propose new solutions.

        <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I created a user testing script and conducted three rounds of user testing in our InVision prototype. Our team tested three to four users per round on the usability and navigability of the app. We discovered from our testing that all test participants enjoyed having the map on the home page and tab navigation bar, likening it to Google Maps and One Bus Away. However, users had trouble identifying where certain features were located such as filters.

        <h5>Design Iterations</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our interaction designer took the findings from our usability testings and developed designs to address user concerns. In our second design iterations, filters were added under settings because half of our test participants in our first round of testing went there first. In our third design iteration, our interaction designer added a text bubble to further assist users with finding the filter feature in settings. During third round of testing, we noticed that one out of three of our users struggled with locating filters. Despite the other two users finding the feature easily, we did not test with enough users.

        <h5>Next Steps</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
        The next step would be to do more usability testing to see if the inclusion of the text bubble assists users with locating the filter options. Our team would then explore features in visual design and move on to the development phase.

        <h5>Learnings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
        I believed our team should have started our first design iterations on paper or at low fidelity. Because we jumped to mid-fidelity using Sketch and inVision, this made it harder to pin-point issues that could’ve been related to the core of the design rather than the specific features. As a result, we were confined to a specific design early on. I also learned that it was important to test designs with more users as three was not enough to make many conclusions. In addition, I felt it was a mistake that we moved the filters option from the settings category as outlined originally in our proposed site map. Even though card sorting participants felt filters belonged in settings, we moved it to a different area early on in our redesign without consulting users.
