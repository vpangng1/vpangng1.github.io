        <p><b>My Role:</b> Interaction Designer</p>

        <h5>Background</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Hazel Analytics is a food tech company offering food safety analytics to big chain restaurants. They are currently trying to market their products to small chain and independent restaurants. As the interaction designer, my task was to come up with a mid-fidelity prototype for these type of users.
        </p>

        <h5>Research</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team discovered through our research findings that independent and small chain restaurant owners had different motivations and attitudes toward food safety inspection. This led to the creation of two different user personas - Jessica, the independent restaurant owner, and Michael, the multi-unit franchisee owner. We also discovered through affinity mapping that both our personas use iPads. Based on this, our team decided that designing an iPad-based prototype was the best direction forward.
        </p>

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The Food Safety Intelligence app was designed to help restaurant owners gain insights about their operations and make better informed decisions related to health safety. We have observed that independent and small chain restaurant owners juggle between many responsibilities including training & hiring staff, maintaining food safety logs, and keeping track of health inspections. How might our app design enable restaurant owners to better prepare for health inspections, thus allowing them to run their operations more smoothly and efficiently?

          <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>
            We believe the food safety intelligence app will allow restaurant owners to stay organized and better prepared for health inspections, allowing them to focus on other areas of the restaurant operation. We will know this to be true when we see that our users are satisifed with the usability of the app.

        <h5>Feature Analysis</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I looked at existing apps in the food safety space to find common features that would address our persona's needs such as easy access to information and being able to compare across restaurants. These features included notifications & alerts, walkthroughs, and data visualization.

      <h5>Design Studio</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <p>
        I conducted a design studio session with our client stakeholders to learn more about their vision of the product. We ultimately decided to limit our product design ideation and iteration around a customizable default dashboard because the dashboard was the centralized place where users can view and customize what they want to see.

        <h5>Prioritize Features</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team conducted a feature prioritization matrix to prioritize what to include in the customizable dashboard. Due to time constraints, our team decided to focus on the default single & multi-unit views, dashboard customization, notification feed, and health department info as they address our persona's main needs of wanting to access information about their restaurant(s).

        <h5>Task flow</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
         I evaluated all our research and listed out the steps in a task flow diagram to understand how our target users would navigate to the dashboard view. I created two different flows for each user based on the needs and goals of our user personas. One of the main takeaways from the task flow was designing the onboarding experience for our target users as they would be using the same app. After that, they would need a way to customize their dashboard.

        <h5>Design Approach</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
         Once the steps were mapped out, I designed the screens to show the content and actions available on each screen for prototype testing. Early concept sketches of our design consisted of pencil sketches & paper cutouts. 
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="contentblock">
      <div class="left">
        <h3>Onboarding</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The onboarding experience consists of entering in restaurants and adding additional fields for entry. The amount of restaurants that are entered determines if the user is single-unit or multi-unit.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="contentblock">
      <div class="left">
        <h3>Restaurant Toggle</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          On the dashboard, multi-unit users can quickly switch between the restaurants they manage through the toggler by clicking on the number associated with each restaurant. This feature is not available for single-unit users.
        </p>
       </div>
    </div>

    <div class="contentblock">
      <div class="left">
        <h3>Add Modules</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Users can add modules to the dashboard by clicking on the add module button or selecting customize dashboard from settings. Both options were included in the initial design to test which method was more intuitive. From the dashboard customization screen, users can click on the module to add them to the dashboard.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="contentblock">
      <div class="left">
        <h3>Customize Modules</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Users can customize the information in the individual module by clicking on the filter icon in the top right corner. On the filter screen, users can filter the information of the module based on specific criteria.
        </p>

        <h5>Testing & Findings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team conducted three rounds of usability testing. We conducted the first round of prototyping with paper cutouts and the second and third rounds in Figma. Feedback from our first designs were generally unfavorable, with users stating that it was unintuitive and overwhelming to use.

        <h5>Design Iterations</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I took the findings from our usability testings and developed design iterations to address user concerns. I made the following changes in our design iterations to improve intuitiveness and usability.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="contentblock">
      <div class="left">
        <h3>Onboarding</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
         I redesigned the add restaurant button after our first tests because three of our test particpants mistook it for a confirmation button. Testers also felt there needed to be additional verification to make sure users entered in the restaurant information correctly, so I created a confirmation screen in the next iteration.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="contentblock">
      <div class="left">
        <h3>Restaurant Toggle</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Based on our first test findings, test participants felt that the restaurant toggler should include the name of the restaurants as users may not remember what number is associated with which restaurant. In the next design iteration, the restaurant toggler was changed to a drop down menu so that users knew which restaurant they were switching to.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

   <div class="contentblock">
      <div class="left">
        <h3>Add Modules</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          We discovered from our first round of testing that four of our users found it more intuitive to click on settings to add modules than to click on the plus button. Based on this observation I decided to put this option under menu settings in the first iteration. Four out of our six testers described the customization screen to be overwhelming and confusing. Based on the feedback, I redesigned the customization screen into a pop out menu and reorganized the categories into a drop down menu. I also included a question mark icon next to each module so users could learn more about it.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="contentblock">
      <div class="left">
        <h3>Customize Modules</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
           Users from our first usability test experienced difficulty locating the filter option to customize individual modules, with two of our testers stating that they were not familiar with the filter icon. This was changed to a pencil icon in the next iteration to make it more identifiable. 
        </p>
      </div>

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          In the final version of our prototype, I made subtle changes to how information was presented to the user in order to make it more usable and intuitive. These changes included visual cues such as check marks for better validation. One of the biggest additions I made in the final design was a skippable walkthrough that was automatically prompted for users using the app for the first time. This was included to assist with user guidance and help deal with the sense of overwhelmingness. 
        </p>

        <h5>Next Steps</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
            The next step of this project would be to conduct more usability tests with more users and restaurant owners. Despite our researcher doing all she could to recruit users very early during the project, we had a very limited pool of target users to work with due to restaurant owners being generally busy people. More feedback from our target users would have influenced my design direction. I would also need to complete the prototype and make sure all functionality was accounted for to give users the full experience.

        <h5>Learnings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
           One of the biggest takeaways from this project was learning to time manage and being more vocal. Even though I wasn't an Information Architect or UX Researher, it was still important to ask questions and be vocal with your team in order to facilitate group understanding. This is especially important when working with limited time. Working with our client has been extremely eye-opening to me as it has made me aware of designing with users in mind and how that can affect your design.
