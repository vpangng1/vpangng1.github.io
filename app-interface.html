        <p>
          Hazel Analytics is a food tech company that offers food safety analytics to restaurants so they can stay compliant with food safety inspections and regulations. Their goal is to expand their product offerings to small chain and independent restaurants. As the interaction designer, <b>my task was to come up with a mid-fidelity prototype for these types of restaurant businesses</b>.

        <h5>Research Insights</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our user researcher discovered through her findings that independent and small chain restaurant owners had different motivations and attitudes toward food safety inspection. This led to the creation of two different user personas - Jessica, the independent restaurant owner, and Michael, the multi-unit franchisee owner. <b>Jessica is someone who cares about her competition and is driven by quality. </b>However, she is not tech savvy and needs easy access to information. On the other hand, <b>Michael is not concerned about the competitive landscape but wants to be able to easily view his restaurants to discover patterns, trends, and insights</b>.

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The Food Safety Intelligence app was designed to help restaurant owners gain insights about their operations and make better informed decisions related to health safety. <b>We have observed that independent and small chain restaurant owners juggle between many responsibilities including training & hiring staff, maintaining food safety logs, and keeping track of health inspections</b>.  
        </p>

    </div>

          <h5>Solution</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>
            <b>We believe the food safety intelligence app will allow restaurant owners to stay organized and better prepared for health inspections</b>, allowing them to focus on other areas of the restaurant operation. We will know this to be true when we see that our users are satisifed with the app.

        <h5>Design Studio</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I facilitated a design studio session with our client stakeholders to learn more about their vision of the product. In addition to brainstorming design ideas, we also discussed the following:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Challenge:</b> There were concerns that there wouldn't be a need for the app because health safety inspections happen infrequently (depending on the frequency and severity of violation would warrant recurrent checkups and inspections), so there needed to be ways to incentivize users to keep using it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Decision Point:</b> In the time that we had, our team decided to limit the product design ideation and iteration around a customizable default dashboard where our target users can view all of their information at-a-glance. To incentivize users to keep using the app, we explored many design features in the dashboard screen such as feed, insights, gamification, etc.

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team conducted a feature prioritization matrix to prioritize what to include in the dashboard screen. Due to time constraints, we could not cover all possible features, so <b>we decided to focus on the features that were essential to our user's needs that were low cost and effort</b>.

        <h5>Design Ideation & Sketches</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Early concept sketches of the dashboard screen consisted of pencil sketches & paper cutouts. I designed the dashboard view around a tablet device because both our model user uses iPads.

        <h3>Dashboard View</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I created the dashboard view based on the client's design system and mockups. I added <b>features such as the hazel score, food safety rank, inspection history, and news feed</b> onto the dashboard because we wanted to motivate our target users to keep using the app.

        <h5>Usability Testing & Findings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team conducted three rounds of usability testing. We conducted the first round of prototyping with paper cutouts and the second and third rounds in Figma. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Test Findings:</b> Testers stated because health safety inspections happen every six to twelve months, restaurant owners would just work off of the latest report. Rules and restrictions change every year, so there wouldn't be much value looking at inspection reports from six months or a year ago. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
           However, participants acknowledged that knowing ahead of time about upcoming inspections and regulation changes would be helpful for businesses to stay ahead. One user in particular stated that inspections felt very demeaning and wished inspections taught her how to be successful.  
         </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One former restaurant owner mentioned that the key to successful inspections is making sure staff is properly trained and adhering to policies. He stated it can be an ongoing battle to make sure everyone is trained and that being able to track and manage who has been trained or not would be extremely useful.

        <h5>Design Iterations & Wireframes</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I took the findings from our usability testings and developed design iterations to address user concerns. I made the following changes in our design iterations to improve intuitiveness and usability.

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          In the next iteration of the dashboard screen, I added an alert feature so users get <b>notified of new rules, restrictions, and food recalls</b>. I also added the <b>insights feature to include goals and tasks</b>. Lastly, I included an <b>employee training list to ensure employees are trained</b>.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          In the final prototype, I made changes to how information was presented to the user in order to make it more intuitive and less overwhelming. These changes included visual cues such as check marks for better validation and walkthroughs to make information easily more digestible. This was done based on testing feedback saying the app would be difficult to use for non-tech savvy users.

          <b>Be vocal to facilitate group understanding:</b> One of the biggest challenges of the project was working with limited amount of information. As my team and I had very little experience in food safety, we had to learn on the fly and rely on information from outside resources, interviews, and our client. It is important to share and contribute everything you've learned with your team on a daily basis to ensure everyone is on the same page.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Leverage client resources early on:</b> When working with limited knowledge and information, it is imperative to utilize your client for resources. With the design system and mockups provided by the client, I was able to get inspiration needed to start and complete the designs.
