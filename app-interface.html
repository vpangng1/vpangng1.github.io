          Hazel Analytics is a food tech company that offers food safety analytics to restaurants so they can stay compliant with food safety inspections and regulations. They are looking to expand their product offerings to small chain and independent restaurants. As the interaction designer, <b>my task was to come up with a mid-fidelity prototype for these types of restaurant businesses</b>.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our user researcher discovered through her findings that independent and small chain restaurant owners had different motivations and attitudes toward food safety inspection. This led to the creation of two different user personas - Jessica, the independent restaurant owner, and Michael, the multi-unit franchisee owner. <b>Jessica is someone who cares about her competition and is driven by quality. </b>However, she is not tech savvy and needs easy access to information. On the other hand, <b>Michael is not concerned about the competitive landscape but wants to be able to easily view his restaurants to discover patterns, trends, and insights </b>.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The Food Safety Intelligence app was designed to help restaurant owners gain insights about their operations and make better informed decisions related to health safety. <b>We have observed that independent and small chain restaurant owners juggle between many responsibilities including training & hiring staff, maintaining food safety logs, and keeping track of health inspections. </b> How might our app design enable restaurant owners to better prepare for health inspections, thus allowing them to run their operations more smoothly and efficiently?

          <p>
            <b>We believe the food safety intelligence app will allow restaurant owners to stay organized and better prepared for health inspections, allowing them to focus on other areas of the restaurant operation.</b> We will know this to be true when we see that our users are satisifed with the usability of the app.

          Because food safety is a very niche, our client had little to no direct competition. However, there was value in looking at similar existing apps in the food safety space for features they have in common that would address our user's needs and concerns. <b>I discovered most apps have visual data, help tools, and notifications & alerts</b>.

        <h5>Design Studio</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I facilitated a design studio session with our client stakeholders to learn more about their vision of the product. In addition to brainstorming design ideas, we also discussed the following:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Challenge:</b> There were concerns that there wouldn't be a need for the app because health safety inspections happen infrequently (depending on the frequency and severity of violation would warrant recurrent checkups and inspections), so there needed to be ways to incentivize users to keep using it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Decision Point:</b> In the time that we had, we decided to limit the product design ideation and iteration around a customizable default dashboard because it was the centralized screen where our target users can view all of their tailored information at-a-glance. To incentivize users to keep using the app, we explored many design features in the dashboard screen such as feed, insights, gamification, etc.

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team conducted three rounds of usability testing. We conducted the first round of prototyping with paper cutouts and the second and third rounds in Figma. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Test Findings:</b> Testers stated because health safety inspections happen every six to twelve months, restaurant owners would just work off of the latest report. Rules and restrictions change every year, so there wouldn't be much value looking at inspection reports from six months or a year ago. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
           However, participants acknowledged that knowing ahead of time about upcoming inspections and regulation changes would be helpful for businesses to stay ahead. One user in particular stated that inspections felt very demeaning. She wished inspections taught her how to be successful.  
         </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One former restaurant owner mentioned that the key to successful inspections is making sure staff is properly trained and adhering to policies. He stated it can be an ongoing battle to make sure everyone is trained and that being able to track and manage who has been trained or not would be useful.

          <b>Be vocal to facilitate group understanding:</b> One of the biggest challenges of the project was working with limited amount of information. As my team and I had very little experience in food safety, we had to learn on the fly and rely on information from outside resources, interviews, and our client. It is important to share everything you've learned with your team on a daily basis to make sure everyone is on the same page.

          <b>Get input and leverage resources early on:</b> Our team had a very limited pool of target users to work with due to restaurant owners being generally busy people. In retrospect, my team and I should've incentivized restaurant owners more or contacted our client early on to get more information. More feedback from our target users would have influenced my design decision early on.
