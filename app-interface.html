      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Hazel Analytics is a food tech company that offers food safety analytics to big chain restaurants. They are currently trying to market their products to small chain and independent restaurants. As the interaction designer, my task was to come up with a mid-fidelity prototype for single unit and multi-unit restaurant owners.

        <h5>Research</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our user researcher discovered through research findings and affinity mapping that independent and small chain restaurant owners had different motivations and attitudes toward food safety inspection. This led to the creation of two different user personas - Jessica, the independent restaurant owner, and Michael, the multi-unit franchisee owner. Jessica is someone who cares about her competition and is driven by quality. However, she is not tech savvy and needs easy access to information. On the other hand, Michael is not concerned about the competitive landscape but wants to be able to easily view his different restaurants to discover patterns, trends, and insights.

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The Food Safety Intelligence app was designed to help restaurant owners gain insights about their operations and make better informed decisions related to health safety. We have observed that independent and small chain restaurant owners juggle between many responsibilities including training & hiring staff, maintaining food safety logs, and keeping track of health inspections. How might our app design enable restaurant owners to better prepare for health inspections, thus allowing them to run their operations more smoothly and efficiently?

          <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>
            We believe the food safety intelligence app will allow restaurant owners to stay organized and better prepared for health inspections, allowing them to focus on other areas of the restaurant operation. We will know this to be true when we see that our users are satisifed with the usability of the app.

        <h5>Comparative Analysis</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Because food safety is a very niche, our client had little to no direct competition. However, there was value in looking at similar existing apps in the food safety space for common features that would address our personas' needs of easy information accessbility and trend comparison across multiple restaurants.

      <h5>Design Studio</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <p>
        I conducted a design studio session with our client stakeholders to learn more about their vision of the product. We ultimately decided to limit the product design ideation and iteration around a customizable default dashboard because it was the centralized screen where users can view all of their restaurant information all at once. Because both our personas use iPads, our team decided that designing around an iPad-based prototype was the best direction forward.

        <p>
          Our team conducted a feature prioritization matrix to prioritize what to include in the customizable dashboard. Due to time constraints, our team decided to focus on the default single & multi-unit views, customization, notification feed, and health department info as they address our personas' main needs of wanting to view all their information about their restaurant(s).

        <h5>Task Flow</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
         I evaluated all our research and listed out the steps in a task flow diagram to understand how our target users would navigate through the dashboard. I created two different flows for each user based on the needs and goals of our user personas. One of the main takeaways from the task flow was designing the onboarding experience for both our target users as they would be using the same app.

        <h5>Design Approach</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
         Once the steps were mapped out, I designed the screens to show the content and actions available on each screen for prototype testing. Early concept sketches of our design consisted of pencil sketches & paper cutouts. 
        </p>

        <h3>Default View</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The dashboard view for both single and multi-unit restaurant owners consists of a grid that can be filled with modules. Every module has its own dimensions that can be positioned and organized anywhere on the grid. The inspiration for this was drawn from the home screen of iOS and Android devices that allow users to easily drag and drop apps & widgets. By default, modules such as average hazel score, food safety rank, inspection history, and notification/feed are automatically added onto the dashboard as they were the most important to our user's needs.

        <h3>Onboarding</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The onboarding experience consists of entering in restaurants and adding additional fields for entry. The amount of restaurants that are entered determines if the user is single unit or multi-unit.

          In the multi-unit view, users can quickly switch between the restaurants they manage through the toggler by clicking on the number associated with each restaurant. This feature is not available for single unit users.

          Users can add modules to the dashboard by selecting customize dashboard from settings or clicking on the plus button. Both options were included in the initial design to test which method was more intuitive. From the dashboard customization screen, users can click on the module to add them to the dashboard.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team conducted three rounds of usability testing. We conducted the first round of prototyping with paper cutouts and the second and third rounds in Figma. Feedback from our first designs were generally unfavorable, with users stating that it was unintuitive to use and that there was an overwhelming amount of information.

          I took the findings from our usability testings and developed design iterations to address user concerns. I made the following changes in our design iterations to improve intuitiveness and usability.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
         I redesigned the add restaurant button after our first tests because three of our test particpants mistook it for a confirmation button. Testers also felt there needed to be additional verification to make sure users entered in the restaurant information correctly, so I created a confirmation screen in the next iteration.

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Based on our first test findings, test participants felt that the restaurant toggler should include the name of the restaurants as users may not remember what number is associated with which restaurant. In the next design iteration, the restaurant toggler was changed to a drop down menu so that users knew which restaurant they were switching to.

        <h3>Add Modules</h3>

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          We discovered from our first round of testing that four of our users found it more intuitive to click on settings to add modules than clicking on the plus button. I removed the plus button and kept the add modules option under menu settings in the next design iteration. Four out of our six testers described the customization screen to be overwhelming and confusing. Based on the feedback, I redesigned the customization screen into a pop out menu and reorganized the categories into a drop down menu.

        <p>
          One of the biggest additions I made in the final design iteration was a skippable walkthrough as part of the onboarding process. The inclusion was made based on the feedback from users mentioning that the app felt sophisticated and that a walkthrough would be helpful for non-tech savvy people.

          In the final version of our prototype, I made subtle changes to how information was presented to the user in order to make it more intuitive and less overwhelming. These changes included visual cues such as check marks for better validation and color to draw users attention to certain features. I also made sure functionality was accounted for.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
            The next step of this project would be to conduct more usability tests with more restaurant owners to assess the intuitiveness of the app. Despite our researcher doing all she could to recruit users very early during the project, we had a very limited pool of target users to work with due to restaurant owners being generally busy people. More feedback from our target users would have influenced my design direction early on. I would also need to complete the prototype and make sure all functionality was accounted for to give users the full experience.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
           One of the biggest takeaways from this project was learning to time manage and being more vocal. It is imperative to ask questions and be vocal with your team in order to facilitate group understanding. This is especially important when working with limited time. Working with our client has been extremely eye-opening to me as it has made me aware of designing with users in mind and how that can affect your design.
