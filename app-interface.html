        <p>
          Hazel Analytics is a food tech company that offers food safety analytics to big chain restaurants. They are currently trying to market their products toward small chain and independent restaurants. As the interaction designer, my task was to come up with a mid-fidelity prototype for these type of users.

        <h5>Research</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our team discovered through our research findings that independent and small chain restaurant owners had different motivations and attitudes toward food safety inspection. This led to the creation of two different user personas - Jessica, the independent restaurant owner, and Michael, the multi-unit franchisee owner. We also discovered through affinity mapping that both our personas use iPads. Based on this, our team decided that designing an iPad-based prototype was the best direction forward.

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The Food Safety Intelligence app was designed to help restaurant owners gain insights about their operations and make better informed decisions related to health safety. We have observed that independent and small chain restaurant owners juggle between many responsibilities including training & hiring staff, maintaining food safety logs, and keeping track of health inspections. How might our app design enable restaurant owners to better prepare for health inspections, thus allowing them to run their operations more smoothly and efficiently?

        <div class="right">
          <p>
            We believe the food safety intelligence app will allow restaurant owners to stay organized and better prepared for health inspections, allowing them to focus on other areas of the restaurant operation. We will know this to be true when users are able to successfully

        <p>
          I looked at existing apps in the food safety space to find common features that would address our persona's needs such as easy access to information and being able to compare across restaurants. These features included notifications & alerts, walkthroughs, and data visualization tools.

      <p>
        I conducted a design studio session with our client stakeholders to learn more about their vision of the product. We ultimately decided to limit our product design ideation and iteration around a customizable default dashboard because the dashboard was the centralized place where users can view and customize what they want to see.

        <p>
          Our team conducted a feature prioritization matrix to prioritize what features to add to the customizable dashboard. Due to time constraints, our team decided to focus on the default single & multi-unit views, dashboard customization, notification feed, and health department info as they address our personas' main concerns.

         I evaluated all our research and listed out the steps in a task flow diagram to understand how our target users would navigate through the app. I created two different flows for each user based on the needs and goals of our user personas. One of the main takeaways from the task flow was designing the onboarding experience for our target users as they would be sharing the same app.

          Our user researcher, Victoria conducted three rounds of usability testing. We conducted the first round of prototyping with paper cutouts and the second and third rounds with Figma. We gave each tester two different task scenarios and two tasks to complete based on the task flow. We discovered from our first round of testing that users were

        <p>
          After paper prototypes, I began building a low fidelity version of the app in Figma. This covered the sign up and sign on process, restaurant entry and confirmation screens, single-unit dashboard screen, restaurant toggler (multi-unit view), and ability to add modules and filter information.

          In our final version of our prototype, I made changes to how information was presented in the onboarding, filtering, add module, and default view screens. One addition I made in the final design was a skippable walkthrough based off of the testing feedback. Color and iconography was based off of the client's style guide.

           We were only able to focus on a small aspect of the app despite the amount of research we did. This was mostly due to time and people. We also had a very limited pool of real users to test with because restaurant owners are generally busy people. More feedback from these type of users may have had an influence on my design direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given more time, I would've completed the prototype for the full experience. Testing with the complete prototype might have provided me with some valuable insights on the overall design, navigation, and experience.
