          Hazel Analytics is a food tech company specializing in food safety analytical software that they market to restaurants to drive business growth and provide business insights. As part of our client project at General Assembly, I worked as the Interaction Designer tasked with creating an interactive prototype on the iPad platform. Given that we only had 3 weeks, our team, consisting of myself, the Project Manager, and the UX Researcher, focused on the onboarding experience.

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Restaurant owners need a simple way to stay prepared and informed about food safety to help them and their staff plan efficiently and effectively for health department inspections.

      </div>
    </div>

        <div class="right">
          <p>
            Focusing on the default view, customizable dashboard, and the onboarding experience of the app will help restaurant owners better prepare for future health inspections with useful insights whilst also providing them with an overall intuitive experience.

        <h5>Strategic Analysis</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I conducted a comparative analysis on existing apps in the food safety space to discover common features. These included the ability to share information, get help, and visualize data. Even though our topic was very niche, we took notes from existing features in similar apps to help with feature prioritization.

        <p>
          We discovered through affinity mapping that single and multi restaurant owners had different motivations and attitudes toward food safety inspection. This led to the creation of two different user personas. From a design perspective, this meant creating two different designs.

         Using Optimal Workshop, we were able to map out the architecture and sitemap. This allowed me hone in on the MVP and know what to design in the short amount of time that we had.

          Based on the research we collected from our client, the surveys, and the comparative features list, we created a feature prioritization chart using whiteboard and sticky notes to help group which features were high or low on the priority list. This also helped me narrow down on what features to design.

      <p>
        We hosted a design studio at the Hazel Analytics headquarters to brainstorm ideas for the design of the onboarding process and default screens. I presented some preliminary sketches to the client so the client could get a sense of what they should be drawing. Together we discussed what potential features would be on the default screen. This included a streamlined onboarding experience and an intuitive default screen that would have some way to view insights, ranking, competitors, filtering, and news.

          We conducted 3 rounds of user testing. We conducted the 1st round of prototpying with paper cutouts and the 2nd and 3rd round with Figma. In every round, we gave each tester two different task scenarios and two tasks to complete for each.

          After paper prototypes, I began building a low fidelity version of the app in Figma. This covered the sign up and sign on process, restaurant entry and confirmation screens, single-unit dashboard screen, restaurant toggler (multi-unit view), and ability to add modules and filter information.

        <p>
          In our final version of our prototype, I made changes to how information was presented in the onboarding, filtering, add module, and default view screens. One addition I made in the final design was a skippable walkthrough based off of the testing feedback. Color and iconography was based off of the client's style guide.
