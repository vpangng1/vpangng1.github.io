        <p>
          Hazel Analytics is a food tech company specializing in food safety analytics software marketed toward big chain restaurants to gain insights on how to improve health safety ratings and better public health. Our client tasked our team with interviewing restaurant owners and coming up with a food safety analytics prototype for independent and small chain restaurant owners.

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Independent and small chain restaurant owners need a simple way to stay prepared and informed about food safety to help them and their staff plan efficiently and effectively for health department inspections. 
        </p>

        <div class="right">
          <p>
            Focusing on the customizable dashboard and the onboarding experience of the app will help independent and small chain restaurant owners better prepare for future health inspections with useful insights.

        <h5>Strategic Analysis</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I conducted a comparative analysis on existing apps in the food safety space to discover common features. Even though our topic was very niche, we took notes from existing features in similar apps to help with feature prioritization. These included the ability to share information, get help, and visualize data.

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          We discovered through affinity mapping that single and multi restaurant owners had different motivations and attitudes toward food safety inspection. This led to the creation of two different user personas. From a design perspective, this meant potentially designing two different things to fulfill two different user goals.

        <p>
          Based on the research we collected from our client, the surveys, and the comparative features list, we created a feature prioritization chart using whiteboard and sticky notes to help group which features were high or low on the priority list. The features highlighted in black in the chart below are meant to indicate which features we could focus on given the amount of time we had.

        We hosted a design studio at the Hazel Analytics headquarters to brainstorm ideas for the design of the onboarding process and default screens. I presented some preliminary sketches to the client so the client could get a sense of what they should be drawing. Together we discussed what potential features would be on the default screen. This included a streamlined onboarding experience and an intuitive default screen that would have some way to view insights, ranking, competitors, filtering, and news.

         Using Optimal Workshop, we were able to map out the architecture and sitemap. This allowed us to hone in on the MVP. I designed screens around the user and task flow.

          We conducted 3 rounds of user testing. We conducted the 1st round of prototpying with paper cutouts and the 2nd and 3rd round with Figma. In every round, we gave each tester two different task scenarios and two tasks to complete for each.

        <p>
          After paper prototypes, I began building a low fidelity version of the app in Figma. This covered the sign up and sign on process, restaurant entry and confirmation screens, single-unit dashboard screen, restaurant toggler (multi-unit view), and ability to add modules and filter information.

        <p>
          In our final version of our prototype, I made changes to how information was presented in the onboarding, filtering, add module, and default view screens. One addition I made in the final design was a skippable walkthrough based off of the testing feedback. Color and iconography was based off of the client's style guide.

           We were only able to focus on a small aspect of the app despite the amount of research we did. This was mostly due to time and people. We also had a very limited pool of real users to test with because restaurant owners are generally busy people. More feedback from these type of users may have had an influence on my design direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given more time, I would've completed the prototype for the full experience. Testing with the complete prototype might have provided me with some valuable insights on the overall design, navigation, and experience.
