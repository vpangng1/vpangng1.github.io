          Hazel Analytics is a food tech company that offers food safety analytics to restaurants so they can stay compliant with food safety inspections and regulations. They are currently trying to market their products to small chain and independent restaurants. As the interaction designer, my task was to come up with a mid-fidelity prototype for these types of restaurant owners.

        <h5>Research Insights</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our user researcher discovered through her findings that independent and small chain restaurant owners had different motivations and attitudes toward food safety inspection. This led to the creation of two different user personas - Jessica, the independent restaurant owner, and Michael, the multi-unit franchisee owner. Jessica is someone who cares about her competition and is driven by quality. However, she is not tech savvy and needs easy access to information. On the other hand, Michael is not concerned about the competitive landscape but wants to be able to easily view his restaurants to discover patterns, trends, and insights.

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The Food Safety Intelligence app was designed to help restaurant owners gain insights about their operations and make better informed decisions related to health safety. We have observed that independent and small chain restaurant owners juggle between many responsibilities including training & hiring staff, maintaining food safety logs, and keeping track of health inspections. How might our app design enable restaurant owners to better prepare for health inspections, thus allowing them to run their operations more smoothly and efficiently?

          <h5>Solution</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>
            We believe the food safety intelligence app will allow restaurant owners to stay organized and better prepared for health inspections, allowing them to focus on other areas of the restaurant operation. We will know this to be true when we see that our users are satisifed with the usability of the app.

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Because food safety is a very niche, our client had little to no direct competition. However, I believed there was value in looking at similar existing apps in the food safety space for common features that would address our user's needs of being able to easily access information about their restaurants. The common features that I discovered that would best address our user's needs were <b>data visualization</b> (i.e. charts and graphs), <b>help tools</b> (guides, videos, walkthoughs), and <b>notifications & alerts</b>.

      <p>
        I conducted a brainstorming session with our client stakeholders to learn more about their vision of the product. <b>We ultimately decided to limit the product design ideation and iteration around a customizable default dashboard</b> because it was the centralized screen where our target users can view all of their restaurant information from one place. <b>Because both our users use iPads</b>, our team decided that designing around an iPad-based prototype was the best direction forward.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
         I evaluated all our research and listed out the steps in a task flow diagram to understand how our target users would navigate through the app and customize their dashboard. I created two different flows for each user based on the needs and goals of our users. One of the main takeaways from the task flow was designing the onboarding experience for both our target users as the experience would be the same.

        <h5>Design Approach</h5>

      <div class="right">
        <p>
         Once the steps were mapped out, I designed the screens to show the content and actions available on each screen for prototype testing. Early concept sketches of our design consisted of pencil sketches & paper cutouts.

        <h3>Default View</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The dashboard view for both single and multi-unit restaurant owners consists of a grid that can be filled with modules. Every module has its own dimensions that can be positioned and organized anywhere on the grid. The inspiration for this was drawn from the home screen of iOS and Android devices that allow users to easily drag and drop apps & widgets. By default, modules such as average hazel score, food safety rank, inspection history, and notification/feed are automatically added onto the dashboard as they were the most important to our user's needs.

          Our team conducted three rounds of usability testing. We conducted the first round of prototyping with paper cutouts and the second and third rounds in Figma. 
          Feedback from our first designs were generally unfavorable, with users stating that it was unintuitive to use and that there was an overwhelming amount of information.

          I took the findings from our usability testings and developed design iterations to address user concerns. I made the following changes in our design iterations to improve intuitiveness and usability.

        <p>
         I redesigned the add restaurant button after our first tests because three of our test particpants mistook it for a confirmation button. Testers also felt there needed to be additional verification to make sure users entered in the restaurant information correctly, so I included visual cues such as check marks and error indicators.
       </p>

        <p>
          Based on our first test findings, test participants felt that the restaurant toggler should include the name of the restaurants as users may not remember what number is associated with which restaurant. In the next design iteration, the restaurant toggler was changed to a drop down menu so that users knew which restaurant they were switching to.

          Four out of our six testers in our first round of tests described the customization screen to be overwhelming and confusing to use, so I condensed the information into drop down and pop out menus in the next iteration. I also added a help icon in each module so users could quickly learn more about it.

I also created a few versions of the interface that included horizontal views. This was done to see how the app and visual elements would display from different orientations. The designs follow the same principles of the grid system that allows users to position modules anywhere on the dashboard.  Color and visual elements were based off of the client style guide.

        <p>
           One of the biggest challenges of the project was working with limited amount of information. As my team and I had very little experience in food safety, we had to learn on the fly and rely on information from outside resources, interviews, and our client. Another challenge was that we had a very limited pool of target users to work with due to restaurant owners being generally busy people. In retrospect, our team should have anticipated this and planned accordingly to better recruit our target users. More feedback from our target users would have influenced my design direction early on. I also learned it was important to be more vocal to facilitate group understanding. Finally, working with our client has been extremely eye-opening to me as it has made me aware of designing with users in mind and how that should influence your design.
