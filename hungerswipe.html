          HungerSwipe is a mobile application that helps people decide on a place to eat more efficiently. HungerSwipe does this by adopting the swipe operation model seen in popular apps like Tinder. As the visual and interaction designer, <b>I was tasked with coming up with ways to integrate the swipe feature with crowd-sourced local restaurant review & location apps such as Yelp</b>.

        <p>
          Through our findings, surveys, and interviews, our user research team discovered that our <b>target users were mostly young, social media app users who were concerned about money</b>. All interviewees stated that they have had <b>at least one instance of fighting with friends over where to eat</b>. This led to the creation our model user Sierra Miller, a college student who is invested in social media apps, wants to save money, and enjoys sharing her experiences with friends.

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
           When it comes to choosing a place to eat there are factors that have to be taken into consideration such as maximum travel distance, price range, type of food, etc. <b>Deciding which place to eat with one or more people can become a frustrating experience that leads to arguments because their preferences also have to be taken into account</b>.

        <h5>Solution</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          <b>We believe implementing a swipe feature that allows users to swipe on desired restaurants makes it easier for parties to decide where to eat</b>. We will know when we're right when we see an increase in downloads, satisfaction, and ratings.

        <h5>Design Ideation & Sketches</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Early concept sketches of the HungerSwipe app consisted of pen and paper. With Tinder's interface in mind, users would be swiping through restaurants instead of people. <b>This was done to increase simplicity and ease for our target users like Sierra who are already familiar with said app</b>.

        <h5>Usability Testing & Findings</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Our research team conducted three rounds of usability testings. We conducted the first round of prototyping with pen & paper and the second and third rounds in Figma.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Test Findings:</b> Testers expressed concerns about conflict over finding places to eat. In addition, testers were confused if the app was for finding restaurants or people to go to restaurants with. Testers also felt the additon of an average price rating on the card was important to decide where to eat.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Decision Point:</b> To address conflict that may arise while both parties are swiping on possible places to eat, the design team decided to make the process anonymous. To address the issue of what the app is about, our team also decide to include an onboarding process. Our team also decided to incorporate the price rating on the card to make deciding where to eat more efficient.

          Our design team took the findings from our usability testings and developed design iterations to address user concerns. We made the following changes in our design iterations to improve intuitiveness and usability.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I created an onboarding experience based on user feedback to accomplish two goals. The first goal is to explain to users the app's purpose. The second goal is to provide an interactive tutorial for people who are not familiar with swiping.

        <h3>Anonymous Swiping</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The SuperLike feature lets others know that you have expressed interest in a restaurant without letting them know it was you. Restaurants that have been superliked by others will show up in the swipe feed with an overlay. Deciding anonymously through swiping or superliking eliminates the need to discuss or argue about where to eat.
