          HungerSwipe is a mobile application that helps people decide on a place to eat more efficiently. HungerSwipe does this by adopting the swipe operation model seen in popular apps like Tinder. As the visual and interaction designer, <b>I was tasked with coming up with ways to integrate the swipe feature with crowd-sourced local restaurant review & location apps such as Yelp</b>.

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
           When it comes to choosing a place to eat there are factors that have to be taken into consideration such as maximum travel distance, price range, type of food, etc. <b>Deciding which place to eat with one or more people becomes frustrating and can lead to arguments because their preferences have to be taken into account</b>.
        </p>

        <h5>Solution</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          <b>We believe implementing a swipe feature that allows users to swipe left or right on desired restaurants makes it easier for parties to decide where to eat</b>. We will know when we're right when we see an increase in downloads, satisfaction, and ratings.

        <p>
          Through findings, surveys, and interviews, our user research team discovered that our <b>target users were mostly young, social media app users</b>. This led to the creation our model user Sierra Miller; someone who is invested in social media apps and enjoys sharing her experiences with friends. Her pain points include <b>feeling overwhelmed with choices and being indecisive when pressured to make group decisions</b>.

        <br>
        <p class="mtop50">
          <b>Challenge:</b> There were concerns that even though both parties find a match on a restaurant, they still may not agree on the spot to eat. In addition, people were confused if the app was for finding restaurants or people to go to restaurants with.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Decision Point:</b> To address potential conflict that may arise while both parties are swiping on possible places to eat, the design team decided to make the process anonymous until a place has been decided. To address the issue of what the app is about, our team decided on designing an on-boarding process.

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Early concept sketches of the HungerSwipe app consisted of pen and paper. With Tinder's interface in mind, users would be swiping through restaurants instead of people. <b>This was done to increase simplicity and ease for our target users who are already familiar with Tinder</b>.

          In the next iteration of the dashboard screen, I added an <b>alert feature so users get notified of new rules, restrictions, and food recalls</b>. I also expanded on the <b>insights feature to include goals and tasks users could track</b>. Lastly, I included an <b>employee training list to help users track and check in with their employees</b>.
